        <td><font color="navy"><font color="navy"><b>I have just returned from the 54th Reunion of Merrill's Marauders in Huntsville, Alabama. My father, John "Red" Acker, was a Marauder and I have listened to his stories all of my life up until his death in 1993. I appreciate the opportunity to attend this year's reunion and talk again to men who shared a special time in my father's life.<br>
        <br>
        I want to personally thank each Marauder for their sacrifice and heroism during what has become a shining example in American military history. The Marauders were just ordinary American men of basic faith, average abilities and normal American values. But during a time of crisis they rose above themselves to be true heroes and men that America should immortalize and revere.<br>
        <br>
        It is sad today that heroes are thought to be sports figures, entertainers, or even politicians. Shame on society for neglecting the men and women in uniform who stand between America and the terror of the world. The so-called heroes that society recognizes cannot hold a candle to the men that made up the Marauders. A true hero is an everyday Joe who faces harm or even death with eyes unblinking and a heart unwavering though fear is filling his gut. Heroes are those who, though they are afraid, carry out their duty and react in spite of pending death or personal harm. A true hero is a Marauder.<br>
        <br>
        As I watched the Marauders gather and exchange old stories, I saw a little of my father in each of them. Their bodies are bent and aged, some are balding, and all are graying. They don't move as swiftly today and some need help to move at all. But I saw in their eyes the same pride and determination I saw in my father right up till the end of his life. He was a man of honor; they are men standing tall for what they believe in and willing to sacrifice all for their country. I wish I could express the proper level of appreciation for what they did for us.<br>
        <br>
        Today even our Commander in Chief is less than moral and not deserving of the respect of his position. This affects the military men and women of today. They salute the office while wishing they did not have to salute the man. But I saw a group of Army Rangers from Fort Benning look at these Marauders with honor and respect. These young men rubbed elbows with the true heroes of our day. As the Rangers presented the American flag the Marauders stood as tall as their frail bodies would allow. They stood at rigid attention again for "Old Glory" just as they stood defiantly toe to toe with her enemies so many years ago. These gentlemen showed me what real men are made of: duty, honor, and respect. We must never let their memory pass.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, I am proud of each Marauder and thank them for being who they are today. I thank them for giving their lives to put down tyranny, oppression and to preserve freedom in the world. I thank their parents for offering their sons on the altar of freedom. I thank their wives for loving these heroes and making their lives sweet and rewarding. I ask their children to not let their father's memory fade. I am proud to be a Marauder's son and thankful that I can find a little of my father in each surviving Marauder.<br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,<br>
        <br>
        Ronald W. Acker<br>
        A Marauder's Son<br>
