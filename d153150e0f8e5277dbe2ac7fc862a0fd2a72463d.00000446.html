The Marauder 2nd Battalion was trapped at Nhpum Ga (Maggot Hill), every night Roy would crawl out close to the Japanese lines and listen to them talk and secured information. One night he returned with information that the Japanese were going to attempt to cut off a part of the perimeter. After helping set up an ambush Roy waited with the rest of the Marauders for the attack to start. When the attack came the Marauders sprang the trap mowing down the first wave of attackers, when the second wave stalled in confusion Roy stood up and yelled for them to attack attack, causing the second wave to meet the same fate as the first. After the Marauders Roy served in China at the Sino Translation and Interrogation Center (SINTIC).
