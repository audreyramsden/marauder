        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We had been patrolling the trail after the Nhpum Ga battle and had headed toward the Kumon Mountains. I had two scouts ahead, and I was the third man in line. We ran into an enemy ambush, and were successful in eliminating the enemy squad.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In searching the jungles after the skirmish, we found a wounded enemy soldier who had been shot out of a tree. He had been hit in the abdomen and was now lying unconscious on the ground.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our aid man, Joe Gomez, administered first aid, and when the prisoner regained consciousness, Nisei (Japanese-American) interpreter, Sergeant Hank Gosho, began to interrogate him. We were interested in obtaining any information we could about the size, disposition, and armament of local units.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During the interrogation, the prisoner look up and saw the chaplain's cross on my Bible, which I carried in a cut-out canvas pouch on my ammunition belt.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Startled the prisoner asked the interpreter to ask me if I was a Christian. Yes. He then told the story of how three days earlier, he had set up his sniper post in a tree several miles further north. He saw the patrol coming down the trail, and as is common with snipers, he let the enlisted men pass with the hopes of taking out an officer. This would eliminate the leadership of the unit and, the Japanese hoped, bring chaos to the troops.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a sharpshooter, he had a four-power scope on his rifle, and he was rewarded for his patience when an officer came into his sights. He then asked the interpreter to ask me if I was there, and if I was the third man in that line. Yes, I was the third man in that column.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He said he had pulled me into very short range, got a good sight picture on my head, and began to squeeze the trigger. Just then, the sun burst through a rift in the thick jungle canopy overhead. It hit the silver chaplain's cross on my Bible, and the cross zoomed out like a neon light, temporarily blinding him. When he saw that big bright cross there in the jungle and realized what had happened, he could not shoot. He assumed I was a Christian, and he himself had been converted at a mission station in Japan just before being conscripted into the army.<br>
