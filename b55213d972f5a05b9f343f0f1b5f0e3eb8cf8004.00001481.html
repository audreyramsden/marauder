        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Some time in 1942 while station at Fort Mommouth, N. J. my sainted mother gave me a Saint Christopher Medal, which I wore around my neck. As was the custom among Italian-Americans at that time, the medal was a square cloth medal about two by three inches, with a hard oval finished center section, that contained the image of Saint Christopher. Later on, after I was married, my wife Aileen gave me a metal Saint Christopher medal, which fit nicely on my dog tag chain. Since the fabric string that held the cloth medal my mother gave me, would always get tangled with my dog tags chain; I transferred the cloth medal to my wallet.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One Friday at the end of August 1943, while serving with the 76th Signal Company of the 76th Division at, A. P. Hill Va. An organization, that I did not feel comfortable serving with. There came a call for volunteers for a dangerous and hazardous jungle warfare mission. The mission was described to be, three months training and three months jungle combat with an expected 98% casualties. The request emphasized the need for radio equipment repair personal. Since that was my MOS and some how, my doing my part would immune my brothers who were serving in Europe and the fact that I just turned nineteen and was still invincible, I volunteered. It some what bothered me, that I was the only volunteer from the two hundred and forty six men in the 76th Signal Company. A week later I boarded the SS Lurline with the other men that would become Merrill's Marauders. The three-month mission continued until the end of May 1944, when I came down with a bad case of malaria. After three days of high fever that at one point exceeded 105-degree I was evacuated to the Twentieth General Hospital, in Ledo India.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At the Twentieth General Hospital, I spent three weeks, two of which I can't remember anything about, I was finally released for convalesce duty. The day after my release from the hospital, without a chance to recuperate or convalesce. I got caught up in Stilwell's call for anybody who could walk to be sent back into Myitkyina. I may have avoided the situation if not for the fact that the day I left the hospital I was in the mess hall when my platoon leader, for whom I had nothing but contempt, came in and sat at the same table. I picked myself up from the table and in front of the remnants of our platoon, I scornfully said "I'd rather be back in the jungles then sitting at the same table with you". The following morning I was on a C47 headed for Myitkyina, the flight back was smooth and quiet.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At the Myitkyina Air Strip I set up my bedding on the northwest end of the airstrip, on the ground next to the 1st Battalion Command Post, where Col. Lloyd Osborne and the 1st Battalion Chaplain shared their bedding. I shared my bedding with my foxhole buddy Edgar Turner; Turner and I were together from when we started at Ledo India. I don't remember if Turner was there when I arrived or if he came in with me. Since each man carried but one blanket and one poncho, it was customary to bunk in twos, a poncho on the ground, a blanket over the poncho, a blanket for cover and a poncho over that blanket, to keep out the rain. The command post is the last place a man that is being evacuated stops at, before getting on a C47 back to India. Therefore we came into possession of extra equipment that would be left behind by the evacuees, so with extra shelter halves and ponchos, we built our selves a lean-to and covered our foxhole that was twenty feet from the lean-to with two shelter halves that opened on the left. There was a tree at the head of our bedding that gave the ground a slight slope that allowed our head to be comfortable and to keep them dry during the constant rain.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There were about a hundred some odd men from the first Battalion scattered around the west-side of the airstrip, more or less kept in reserve, the fighting for the town of Myitkyina was still going on. Once or twice a day you would hear the whoosh whoosh of one of the Jap's 107mm guns, high over head, followed by the report in the distance. No one ever paid any attention to it, for it was well out of range. One day the powers to be decided that some sort of activity was in order, just to keep the men busy. The remnants of the communication platoon went off in the distance, put up a parachute for a tent and started message center practice. A fellow named John Dillinger (not related to the infamous one) and I were stuck with digging a new latrine for the group. The weather was sweltering hot and humid, while we worked we wore nothing but a pair of BVDs and jungle boots. The ground was soft; therefore it didn't take long to dig two new slit trenches and cover up the old ones. After completing our work we went back to the C. P. area to relax and wait for the rest of the platoon to come back. Soon after our return, a Chinese Soldier appeared, looking to bargain for cigarettes. It was at this moment when we heard whoosh whoosh whoosh bang, we turned to faced each other and said, "that was close". When came another whoosh bang, that left no question about being close. We were now standing in front of the lean-to, hesitant to leave the Chinese Soldier with our possessions unguarded. When for some reason that I still don't understand, for the artillery shell travels faster then sound and when you hear it, it's to late, I made an unbelievable dive for the hole. I traveled the twenty feet in one motion as I lifted the side of the shelter-half and slipped into the foxhole. During my twenty-foot flight the bottom of my jungle boots was being hit with dirt from the blast behind me. What followed seemed like an eternity of one shell after another, while I tried to get deeper and deeper into the hole. Dillinger in the meantime crawled on his elbows to the right all the way, 270 degrees, around the hole till he found the opening in the shelter halves, which was on the left. Because of the soft ground most of the shell blast would have an elevated angle and tend to go over a body on the ground; Dillinger was in shock, but otherwise unhurt.<br>
        <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When it was over and I assessed the damage, I found that the tree took a direct hit and was gone, another shell hit right smack in the center of my blanket, every thing was torn to shreds and riddled with shrapnel. When I located my tattered fatigues and removed my wallet, I found it completely shredded except for a solid section in the center. I opened the wallet and found that, although the edges were shredded the oval part of the Saint Christopher Medal was untouched. When I removed the medal with the photographs I had of Aileen behind it, you could see that although the photos were riddled with shrapnel, the untouched oval behind the Saint Christopher Medal was clearly visible.<br>
