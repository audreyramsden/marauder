          <h3><font color="green"><b>Although the membership voted overwhelmingly for the proposal presented by Francis Ponder and delivered by his daughter Jerrie Daly, who did a fantastic job. The proposal was for the Holiday Inn Select, a short distance from the Mall Of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which is on the south side of Minneapolis. Unfortunately, while reviewing the hotel’s floor plan, it was clear that there would not be the meeting room space we generally require. The hotel then offered a larger area for the registration and memorabilia room but it too proved inadequate. The problem was presented to the Association Officers who concluded that we should try to find another hotel in the area that meets our requirements. A concerted effort to find another hotel was made but all the hotels that were adequate demanded exorbitant package prices and $100 daily room rates. The search results were again presented to the other Association Officers, and they concluded that if the hotel in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, presented by Phil Piazza, meets our requirements and is still available, we should make reunion arrangements there, which it was, and we did.</b></font></h3>
