        1st Lt. Logan E. Weston of Youngstown, Ohio, was called the “Fightin’ Preacher” by the Marauders because he had broken off studying for the ministry to join the Army and go into combat. Weston enlisted in the 37th Division, was graduated from officer training school in Fiji, fought on New Georgia, then volunteered far the Marauders, winding up as leader of an intelligence and reconnaissance platoon that played a key role in Marauder actions from Walawbum on. Here he cleans his carbine ammunition and magazines between patrols.</b></td>
