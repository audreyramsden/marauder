"Merrill&#39;s Marauders Story #0001","The Chaplain's Cross
1stLt Logan E. Weston 5307th 3rd Bat. Orange CBT
We had been patrolling the trail after the Nhpum Ga battle and had headed toward the Kumon Mountains. I had two scouts ahead, and I was the third man in line. We ran into an enemy ambush, and were successful in eliminating the enemy squad. In searching the jungles after the skirmish, we found a wounded enemy soldier who had been shot out of a tree. He had been hit in the abdomen and was now lying unconscious on the ground. Our aid man, Joe Gomez, administered first aid, and when the prisoner regained consciousness, Nisei (Japanese-American) interpreter, Sergeant Hank Gosho, began to interrogate him. We were interested in obtaining any information we could about the size, disposition, and armament of local units. During the interrogation, the prisoner look up and saw the chaplain's cross on my Bible, which I carried in a cut-out canvas pouch on my ammunition belt. Startled the prisoner asked the interpreter to ask me if I was a Christian. Yes. He then told the story of how three days earlier, he had set up his sniper post in a tree several miles further north. He saw the patrol coming down the trail, and as is common with snipers, he let the enlisted men pass with the hopes of taking out an officer. This would eliminate the leadership of the unit and, the Japanese hoped, bring chaos to the troops. As a sharpshooter, he had a four-power scope on his rifle, and he was rewarded for his patience when an officer came into his sights. He then asked the interpreter to ask me if I was there, and if I was the third man in that line. Yes, I was the third man in that column. He said he had pulled me into very short range, got a good sight picture on my head, and began to squeeze the trigger. Just then, the sun burst through a rift in the thick jungle canopy overhead. It hit the silver chaplain's cross on my Bible, and the cross zoomed out like a neon light, temporarily blinding him. When he saw that big bright cross there in the jungle and realized what had happened, he could not shoot. He assumed I was a Christian, and he himself had been converted at a mission station in Japan just before being conscripted into the army.

MARAUDERS NAME:WALTER T. SONDEY
AVAILABLE INFORMATION: I'm searching for more specific service information-as well as anyone who might have served with or known my dad. He was born in Wallingford, Connecticut and entered the service on 20 February 1942, serving first in Newfoundland.

He did share some stories about drinking rice wine and eating monkey stew with the Naga, but was quite selective about some details. He was always proud to have been with the great men of the CBI and I would like to have more information to share with my children (age 6 and 8) as they grow up, as my dad died on November 27, 1997. I do have more service information, but someone might remember him more for his stories-getting thrown in the brig for refusing to do patrol duty because of ""man-eating tigers,"" wandering around India because he got seperated from his unit, etc. etc. I'll share what I know if you'll share with me!

<p><b>MARAUDERS NAME:WALTER T. SONDEY<br />
AVAILABLE INFORMATION: I'm searching for more specific service information-as well as anyone who might have served with or known my dad. He was born in Wallingford, Connecticut and entered the service on 20 February 1942, serving first in Newfoundland. He served, variously, as a Medic B T, Company Aid Man 657, Litter Bearer 657, Squad Leader 657, and Mule Skinner 712. He did share some stories about drinking rice wine and eating monkey stew with the Naga, but was quite selective about some details. He was always proud to have been with the great men of the CBI and I would like to have more information to share with my children (age 6 and 8) as they grow up, as my dad died on November 27, 1997. I do have more service information, but someone might remember him more for his stories-getting thrown in the brig for refusing to do patrol duty because of ""man-eating tigers,"" wandering around India because he got seperated from his unit, etc. etc. I'll share what I know if you'll share with me! Thank you</b></p>

"MERRILL&#39;S MARAUDERS, 2004 REUNION INFORMATION","CLICK ON ""PASS IN REVIEW"" FOR A MEMORIAL TO THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED ON
Every year millions of visitors head for the Arch with one goal in mind: a journey to the top. This is where you'll get a stunning glimpse of the St. Louis region from a dizzying height of 630 feet. But how do you get to the top? You take a tram ride from the south or north leg of the Arch. On your way to the top using the south leg, you'll return to an era in the 1800s when the St. Louis riverfront was bustling with steamboats, fur traders, and merchants. On your way to the top using the north leg, you'll be transported back to 1965 when construction workers wedged the last triangular Arch section into place.
It may be our imagination but the food actually tastes better in the shadow of the Arch? At the Arch View Café on the Riverboat's docking barge, you can dine on hamburgers, chicken strips, fries, salads and other great foods in full view of the monument. For even more food and entertainment options, walk the cobblestone streets of Laclede's Landing which is located next to the Gateway Arch Parking Garage.
Join Gateway Arch Riverboats for one of its spectacular Mississippi River sightseeing cruises. Narrated by our seasoned riverboat captains, these scenic cruises recapture the vibrant life upon the river at the peak of the steamboat era.
Historic ports of call along the Mississippi's banks, lively river characters from Mark Twain to Louis Armstrong and famous river tales are all brought to life in the course of a delightful, hour-long journey up the river and back through time.

"Open Letter To Merrill&#39;s Marauders","OPEN LETTER TO MERRILL'S MARAUDERS
This is an open letter to all Marauders Written by, Ronald W. Acker, the son of Marauder, John ""Red"" Acker, after the 54th Marauder Reunion in September 2000. Thank you Ron for so elegantly expressing what many of us sons and daughters of these brave men feel but could never find the right words to express our feeling.
An Open Letter to Merrill's Marauders
I have just returned from the 54th Reunion of Merrill's Marauders in Huntsville, Alabama. My father, John ""Red"" Acker, was a Marauder and I have listened to his stories all of my life up until his death in 1993. I appreciate the opportunity to attend this year's reunion and talk again to men who shared a special time in my father's life. I want to personally thank each Marauder for their sacrifice and heroism during what has become a shining example in American military history. The Marauders were just ordinary American men of basic faith, average abilities and normal American values. But during a time of crisis they rose above themselves to be true heroes and men that America should immortalize and revere. It is sad today that heroes are thought to be sports figures, entertainers, or even politicians. Shame on society for neglecting the men and women in uniform who stand between America and the terror of the world. The so-called heroes that society recognizes cannot hold a candle to the men that made up the Marauders. A true hero is an everyday Joe who faces harm or even death with eyes unblinking and a heart unwavering though fear is filling his gut. Heroes are those who, though they are afraid, carry out their duty and react in spite of pending death or personal harm. A true hero is a Marauder. As I watched the Marauders gather and exchange old stories, I saw a little of my father in each of them. Their bodies are bent and aged, some are balding, and all are graying. They don't move as swiftly today and some need help to move at all. But I saw in their eyes the same pride and determination I saw in my father right up till the end of his life. He was a man of honor; they are men standing tall for what they believe in and willing to sacrifice all for their country. I wish I could express the proper level of appreciation for what they did for us. Today even our Commander in Chief is less than moral and not deserving of the respect of his position. This affects the military men and women of today. They salute the office while wishing they did not have to salute the man. But I saw a group of Army Rangers from Fort Benning look at these Marauders with honor and respect. These young men rubbed elbows with the true heroes of our day. As the Rangers presented the American flag the Marauders stood as tall as their frail bodies would allow. They stood at rigid attention again for ""Old Glory"" just as they stood defiantly toe to toe with her enemies so many years ago. These gentlemen showed me what real men are made of: duty, honor, and respect. We must never let their memory pass. Finally, I am proud of each Marauder and thank them for being who they are today. I thank them for giving their lives to put down tyranny, oppression and to preserve freedom in the world. I thank their parents for offering their sons on the altar of freedom. I thank their wives for loving these heroes and making their lives sweet and rewarding. I ask their children to not let their father's memory fade. I am proud to be a Marauder's son and thankful that I can find a little of my father in each surviving Marauder. Sincerely, Ronald W. Acker A Marauder's Son","<table>

"Merrill&#39;s Marauders Story #0001","A Medal For St. Cristopher
T/5 Robert E. Passanisi, 5307th 1st Bat. White CBT
Some time in 1942 while station at Fort Mommouth, N. J. my sainted mother gave me a Saint Christopher Medal, which I wore around my neck. As was the custom among Italian-Americans at that time, the medal was a square cloth medal about two by three inches, with a hard oval finished center section, that contained the image of Saint Christopher. Later on, after I was married, my wife Aileen gave me a metal Saint Christopher medal, which fit nicely on my dog tag chain. Since the fabric string that held the cloth medal my mother gave me, would always get tangled with my dog tags chain; I transferred the cloth medal to my wallet. One Friday at the end of August 1943, while serving with the 76th Signal Company of the 76th Division at, A. P. Hill Va. An organization, that I did not feel comfortable serving with. There came a call for volunteers for a dangerous and hazardous jungle warfare mission. The mission was described to be, three months training and three months jungle combat with an expected 98% casualties. The request emphasized the need for radio equipment repair personal. Since that was my MOS and some how, my doing my part would immune my brothers who were serving in Europe and the fact that I just turned nineteen and was still invincible, I volunteered. It some what bothered me, that I was the only volunteer from the two hundred and forty six men in the 76th Signal Company. A week later I boarded the SS Lurline with the other men that would become Merrill's Marauders. The three-month mission continued until the end of May 1944, when I came down with a bad case of malaria. After three days of high fever that at one point exceeded 105-degree I was evacuated to the Twentieth General Hospital, in Ledo India. At the Twentieth General Hospital, I spent three weeks, two of which I can't remember anything about, I was finally released for convalesce duty. The day after my release from the hospital, without a chance to recuperate or convalesce. I got caught up in Stilwell's call for anybody who could walk to be sent back into Myitkyina. I may have avoided the situation if not for the fact that the day I left the hospital I was in the mess hall when my platoon leader, for whom I had nothing but contempt, came in and sat at the same table. I picked myself up from the table and in front of the remnants of our platoon, I scornfully said ""I'd rather be back in the jungles then sitting at the same table with you"". The following morning I was on a C47 headed for Myitkyina, the flight back was smooth and quiet. At the Myitkyina Air Strip I set up my bedding on the northwest end of the airstrip, on the ground next to the 1st Battalion Command Post, where Col. Lloyd Osborne and the 1st Battalion Chaplain shared their bedding. I shared my bedding with my foxhole buddy Edgar Turner; Turner and I were together from when we started at Ledo India. I don't remember if Turner was there when I arrived or if he came in with me. Since each man carried but one blanket and one poncho, it was customary to bunk in twos, a poncho on the ground, a blanket over the poncho, a blanket for cover and a poncho over that blanket, to keep out the rain. The command post is the last place a man that is being evacuated stops at, before getting on a C47 back to India. Therefore we came into possession of extra equipment that would be left behind by the evacuees, so with extra shelter halves and ponchos, we built our selves a lean-to and covered our foxhole that was twenty feet from the lean-to with two shelter halves that opened on the left. There was a tree at the head of our bedding that gave the ground a slight slope that allowed our head to be comfortable and to keep them dry during the constant rain. There were about a hundred some odd men from the first Battalion scattered around the west-side of the airstrip, more or less kept in reserve, the fighting for the town of Myitkyina was still going on. Once or twice a day you would hear the whoosh whoosh of one of the Jap's 107mm guns, high over head, followed by the report in the distance. No one ever paid any attention to it, for it was well out of range. One day the powers to be decided that some sort of activity was in order, just to keep the men busy. The remnants of the communication platoon went off in the distance, put up a parachute for a tent and started message center practice. A fellow named John Dillinger (not related to the infamous one) and I were stuck with digging a new latrine for the group. The weather was sweltering hot and humid, while we worked we wore nothing but a pair of BVDs and jungle boots. The ground was soft; therefore it didn't take long to dig two new slit trenches and cover up the old ones. After completing our work we went back to the C. P. area to relax and wait for the rest of the platoon to come back. Soon after our return, a Chinese Soldier appeared, looking to bargain for cigarettes. It was at this moment when we heard whoosh whoosh whoosh bang, we turned to faced each other and said, ""that was close"". When came another whoosh bang, that left no question about being close. We were now standing in front of the lean-to, hesitant to leave the Chinese Soldier with our possessions unguarded. When for some reason that I still don't understand, for the artillery shell travels faster then sound and when you hear it, it's to late, I made an unbelievable dive for the hole. I traveled the twenty feet in one motion as I lifted the side of the shelter-half and slipped into the foxhole. During my twenty-foot flight the bottom of my jungle boots was being hit with dirt from the blast behind me. What followed seemed like an eternity of one shell after another, while I tried to get deeper and deeper into the hole. Dillinger in the meantime crawled on his elbows to the right all the way, 270 degrees, around the hole till he found the opening in the shelter halves, which was on the left. Because of the soft ground most of the shell blast would have an elevated angle and tend to go over a body on the ground; Dillinger was in shock, but otherwise unhurt. When it was over and I assessed the damage, I found that the tree took a direct hit and was gone, another shell hit right smack in the center of my blanket, every thing was torn to shreds and riddled with shrapnel. When I located my tattered fatigues and removed my wallet, I found it completely shredded except for a solid section in the center. I opened the wallet and found that, although the edges were shredded the oval part of the Saint Christopher Medal was untouched. When I removed the medal with the photographs I had of Aileen behind it, you could see that although the photos were riddled with shrapnel, the untouched oval behind the Saint Christopher Medal was clearly visible.

"MERRILL&#39;S MARAUDERS, 2004 REUNION INFORMATION","CLICK ON ""PASS IN REVIEW"" FOR A MEMORIAL TO THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED ON
Every year millions of visitors head for the Arch with one goal in mind: a journey to the top. This is where you'll get a stunning glimpse of the St. Louis region from a dizzying height of 630 feet. But how do you get to the top? You take a tram ride from the south or north leg of the Arch. On your way to the top using the south leg, you'll return to an era in the 1800s when the St. Louis riverfront was bustling with steamboats, fur traders, and merchants. On your way to the top using the north leg, you'll be transported back to 1965 when construction workers wedged the last triangular Arch section into place.
It may be our imagination but the food actually tastes better in the shadow of the Arch? At the Arch View Café on the Riverboat's docking barge, you can dine on hamburgers, chicken strips, fries, salads and other great foods in full view of the monument. For even more food and entertainment options, walk the cobblestone streets of Laclede's Landing which is located next to the Gateway Arch Parking Garage.
Join Gateway Arch Riverboats for one of its spectacular Mississippi River sightseeing cruises. Narrated by our seasoned riverboat captains, these scenic cruises recapture the vibrant life upon the river at the peak of the steamboat era.
Historic ports of call along the Mississippi's banks, lively river characters from Mark Twain to Louis Armstrong and famous river tales are all brought to life in the course of a delightful, hour-long journey up the river and back through time.

"Do You Know These Men","During World War Two, in the jungles of North Burma, the unit known as MERRILL?S MARAUDERS fought deep behind Japanese lines. They could only communicate with their base by long distance radio and receive supplies by parachute drops from cargo planes. Under these circumstances, records of the men that were killed by enemy action, or died for any other reason, were difficult to keep. The constant rain, mildew and enemy action, took its toll. When a Marauder was killed or died, out of necessity he was buried on the spot, with only a bamboo cross, his helmet and one set of dogtags. Because of this state of affairs a number of Marauders who gave the ultimate sacrifice and because their records were lost, never were acknowledge or rewarded for their performance. They earned, but never received, The Combat Infantry Badge, The Bronze Star Medal, and the Ranger Tab. Due to the persistent effort by the many involved, this error of omission has been corrected and now the difficult task is to find the next of kin of these heroes, to receive the awards. historian1@marauder.org

"YANK WEEKLY 9 JUNE 1944, MERRILL&#39;A MARAUDERS IN BURMA","Yank The Army Weekly-CBI-Edition June 09 1944-Vol. 2 No 51 By Sgt. Dave Richardson
Yank Staff Correspondent.
Behind Jap Lines in Burma With Merrill's Marauders
Merrill's Marauders in Burma
*The story and pictures on these pages are the first YANK has received from Sgt. Dave Richardson since he was swallowed up in the Burma jungles for more than three months.Richardson's long hitch with the Marauder force, commanded by Brig. Gen. Frank D Merrill, took him farther behind Japanese lines in Northern Burma than any other correspondent covering the theater. A veteran of the New Guinea fighting, Richardson marched 500 miles with the Marauders and took part in all but one of their actions. The accompanying account of the first battle between a U.S. Infantry platoon and a Jap force on the continent of Asia will be followed by other stories and pictures as they are received. Behind Japanese Lines In Northern Burma The crackle of a couple of Nambu light machine guns and the whipsnap of Ariska rifles stopped the single-file column of Merril's Marauders and sent the men scrambling for cover on both sides of the narrow jungle trail. They had trudged nearly 250 miles in the last four weeks. After marching up 116 miles of the Ledo Road, they had swung wide around the Jap positions that were holding up the Chinese drive in the Hukawng Valley of Northern Burma. They had followed narrow native paths and elephant trails through dense undergrowth and high elephant grass and across dozens of rivers and streams. This was to be the first of their missions as a volunteer raiding outfit behind Jap lines--attacking the enemy rear supply base of Walawbum to force a Jap withdrawal 30 miles northward so the Chinese could push through. The Marauders led by Brig. Gen. Frank D Merrill, who had walked out of Burma with Stilwell two years before, were this afternoon only three miles from their goal. The CO of the unit that had bumped into Jap resistance sent for 1st Lt. Logan E Weston of Youngstown, Ohio. A slim, quet pokerfaced young officer, Weston edged his way through the bush to the CO's side. ""Weston,"" said the CO, ""take your intelligence and reconnaissance platoon across the river and move south to a position near the river bank that will cover us from the Walawbum area when we drive through this village of Langag Ga. on the east bank."" Lt. Weston, like most of the others in this Marauder unit, had fought Japs before. Quitting Transylvania Bible School in Freeport, Pa., midway through his study for the ministry, he had joined the Army. He went to the South Pacific as a squad leader in the 37th Division, he was graduated from OCS in the Fiji's, and then he fought in New Georgia as a platoon leader in the 37th. That's where he picked up a nickname. ""Fightin' Preacher,"" his men called him. As one of his original platoon explained it, ""Lt. Weston continued his bible study in spare moments, but when we got into a scrap with the Japs he was one of the fightingest platoon leaders in the outfit."" In New Georgia the Fightin' Preacher had always made one point clear to his men: he did not like to kill. After each action he got his men aside and said, half-apologetically: ""I'm sorry I had to kill those Japs, fellas, but today it was a case of either my getting them or their getting me."" Lt. Weston's tough, swaggering platoon was a marked contrast to its gentle, mild-mannered leader. Among his men were such veterans as Cpl. Werner Katz of New York, N.Y., who fought with the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War and with the Americal Division on Guadacanal. Katz, a burly first scout, became the first American Infantryman to kill a Jap on the continent of Asia when the platoon had a fleeting brush with a Jap patrol the week before. Then there was Pfc. Norman J. (Chief) Janis, a full-blooded Sioux Indian and former rodeo rider from Deadwood, S. Dak., who thought it was a bad day during the Buna battle in New Guinea if he had to use more than one bullet to kill a Jap. And Sgt. William L Grimes of Lonaconing, Md., who won the Silver Star for knocking off 25 Japs at Quadalcanal. And a couple of dozen others who had battled Japs in the jungles and swamps of the South and Southwest Pacific. They had all volunteered for this ""dangerous and hazardous"" jungle-fighting mission. The Fightin' Preacher's men got to their feet and slung on their 60-pound horseshoe-type packs. They moved through the dark jungle undergrowth down to the muddy little river and crossed it Indian file wading 40 feet to the other side through crotch-deep water. Then, rifles cradled in their arms, they climbed the bank. They rustled their way through the brush alongside the riverbank all afternoon, cautiously covering a few hundred yards. One or twice the scouts spotted Jap sentries and traded a few bullets with them, but the Japs got away. Just before dusk the platoon halted and dug in a perimeter of fox holes to spend the night. They could hear the main body of Marauders pushing through the Jap resistance across the river, using lots of tommy guns and BAR's. The men ate no supper; they had run out of K-rations two days before. (While the Marauders were behind the Jap lines, they were supplied entirely by airdrop and there were never any drops when the men were sneaking close to their objective, because this might reveal their position and strength.) There was nothing for the men to do but decide on the hours of perimeter guard and then curl up in blanket and poncho and go to sleep. By dawn the next morning the Fightin' Preacher's platoon was on the move again. The scouts had located a bend in the river from which the platoon could command a wide field of fire to the south.From here they could cover the main Marauder unit as it pushed down the trail along the opposite bank. The river bend was only 150 yards away from the night perimeter, and the platoon reached it in half an hour in the early-morning fog. They started to dig in at 0700 hours. Half an hour later Pvt. Pete Leitner, a scout from Okeechobee, Fla., was out in front of the perimeter collecting green branches to camouflage his fox hole when a Nambu light machine gun opened up. Leitner was hit in the middle and crumpled to the ground, severely wounded. Before anyone could get his sights on the Jap machine gunner, he ran away through the brush. Sgt. Paul Mathis of Grey Eagle, Minn., platoon guide and Lt. Weston went out and dragged Leitner back to the perimeter. The rest of the men in the platoon got down in their holes and braced themselves for a Jap attack. They didn't have long to wait. Through the brush they spotted tan-uniformed Japs walking toward them at a crouch, some with twigs camouflaging their helmets. The platoon opened up. The Japs hit the ground and fanned out, crawling closer and shooting furiously. The Japs chattered among themselves; some seemed to be giving commands. Then came the hollow snap of knee mortars being discharged behind the Japs. Seconds later the mortar shells exploded in the trees over the Fightin' Preacher's men. After that the mortars were fired in salvoes. ""Five Japs on the right flank!"" somebody yelled. Sgt. John Gately of Woburn, Mass., spotted the first one and killed him. Pfc. Harold Hudson of Bristol, Conn., glimpsed the other four and mowed them all down, starting his tommy gun at the rear of the quartet and working forward. The main Jap attack was coming in the center of the platoon's defense. A squad of Japs moved in closer, crawling and shooting. Grimmes, the Silver Star winner from Guadalcanal, now added to his record of 25 Japs by pumping bullets into each one that lifted his head. T-5 Raymond F Harris of Pekin, Ill., sprayed the squad with his BAR as some of the Japs managed to creep within 30 feet of his position. One Jap shot at Harris just as he ducked his head to put a magazine in his BAR. The bullet dented his helmet. Inside the perimeter, Lt. Weston and his platoon sergeant, T/Sgt. Alfred M Greer of Malden, Mass., got a message from Pfc. Benny Silverman of New York, N.Y., walkie-talkie radioman, that the main body of the Marauders had chased the remaining Japs from the opposite bank of the river and had taken up position there. ""Fine"" the Fightin' Preacher told Greer. ""Let's get them to help us with their mortars."" Acting as mortar observer, Greer got Silverman to radio back a rough estimate of positions based on his map. Soon the crack of a mortar discharge answered from across the river. An 81-mm mortar shell burst with a hollow explosion behind the Japs. Greer gave Silverman new elevation and azimuth figures. Another mortar shell lobbed over. It burst a little closer to the Japs but over to one side. ""Anybody got a compass with mils on it instead of degrees?"" asked Greer. Near him Cpl. Joe Gomez, aid man from Gallup, N. Mex., had just finished working on Sgt. Lionel Parquette of Calumet, Mich., who was mortally wounded in the head. Gomez opened a pouch at his belt and handed his compass over to Greer. ""We medics got everything,"" he grinned. Greer told the mortars to lay in a smoke shell and he took an azimuth reading on it. Then he gave Siverman a new set of figures to radio the mortar crew. Across the river, the mortar chief--1st Lt. William F Woomer of State Collage, Pa., called ""Woomer the Boomer"" in New Guinea--shouted the figure to the mortar crew. Sgt. Edwin Kopec of Lowell, Mass.; Pvt. James McGowan of West Newton, Mass., and Pvt. Wise Alderman of Floyd, Va., set the figures on the scales and lobbed over another one. Theirs was the only mortar in position to fire across the river. Another mortar crew was changing it's position to clear some trees with its trajectory. Soon with Greer's observation, the mortars were right on their target. Greer then varied the figures every few rounds to cover the Japs from the flank. ""Nice going boys,"" he yelled after a series of six burst. ""We just saw a couple of Japs blown out of their holes 40 yards from our point man."" As fast as the mortarmen could rip open shell cases, they poured fire across the river. The Japs kept coming. They edged into position on three sides of the perimeter and were even trying to get between the river and the Fightin' Preacher's platoon. Their machine-gun and rifle fire increased in intensity and volume. Lt. Weston estimated about a company Japs was opposing him. Then Silverman at the walkie-talkie got an order for the platoon to withdraw to the other side of the river. Its mission had been accomplished. There was no use staying to fight the Japs with such a small force when the main body of Marauders was moving south to make a direct attack on Walawbum. Greer, Siverman and a couple of others made litters out of bamboo poles and buttoned-up fatigue jackets to carry the few wounded who could not walk. Then, under cover of Lt. Woomer's mortar fire, the platoon withdrew to the river and prepared to cross. The Japs followed, figuring on catching them in the riverbed. Across the river four BAR's opened up to cover the crossing. The bullets whined over the platoon's heads. Lt. Weston told Silverman to radio back that the Japs were on the flanks waiting to knock off some men crossing the river. Then two of the platoons peeled off their white undershirts and put one in a tree on each flank of the platoon to serve as firing guides for the BAR's. Just before crossing, Lt. Weston ordered the mortars to throw smoke shells to the rear and flanks of the withdrawing platoon to screen the move. One by one the men of the platoon splashed back across the river as BAR's stuttered away and mortar burst echoed down the riverbed. After Chief Janis, the Indian crack shot, had crossed, he turned to watch Pfc. John E. Clark of Windsor, Vt., and Katz, the International Brigade veteran, carry the wounded Leitner across on a litter. Out of the corner of his eye, Janis spotted a movement in the bushes on the bank. A Jap with a light machine-gun had parted the bushes and was taking aim at the litter-bearers and their burden. Janis raised his M1 and fired two shots. The Jap squealed and slumped over his gun. ""I just wanted to make sure I got him,"" said Janis, explaining the extra shot. His score for the day was seven Japs. Meanwhile the BAR men covering the withdrawal were busy. Japs seemed to pop up all over the riverbank. Pvt. Bob Cole of Englewood, Calif., got six of them, and T-5 Clyde Shields of Egg Harbor, Wis., saw two roll down the bank in his sights At 0930 hours the last man withdrew. The sweating mortarmen were ripping open their 113th shell case when the cease-fire order came. Lt. Weston trudged wearily into the unit CP, head bent as he worked the bolt on his carbine. One of his men watched him with obvious admiration. ""You know"" he said ""the Fightin' Preacher got at least two Japs before we withdrew. I thought he was going to apologize again. Instead, all he said was that he could have got another Jap if his bolt hadn't jammed.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/b_yank3.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/next.gif"" /></p>

Weston ordered the mortars to throw smoke shells to the rear and flanks of the withdrawing platoon to screen the move.          One by one the men of the platoon splashed back across the river as BAR's stuttered away and mortar burst echoed down the riverbed. After Chief Janis, the Indian crack shot, had crossed, he turned to watch Pfc. John E. Clark of Windsor, Vt., and Katz, the International Brigade veteran, carry the wounded Leitner across on a litter. Out of the corner of his eye, Janis spotted a movement in the bushes on the bank. A Jap with a light machine-gun had parted the bushes and was taking aim at the litter-bearers and their burden. Janis raised his M1 and fired two shots. The Jap squealed and slumped over his gun.          ""I just wanted to make sure I got him,"" said Janis, explaining the extra shot. His score for the day was seven Japs.         Meanwhile the BAR men covering the withdrawal were busy. Japs seemed to pop up all over the riverbank. Pvt. Bob Cole of Englewood, Calif., got six of them, and T-5 Clyde Shields of Egg Harbor, Wis., saw two roll down the bank in his sights          At 0930 hours the last man withdrew. The sweating mortarmen were ripping open their 113th shell case when the cease-fire order came. Lt. Weston trudged wearily into the unit CP, head bent as he worked the bolt on his carbine.         One of his men watched him with obvious admiration. ""You know"" he said ""the Fightin' Preacher got at least two Japs before we withdrew. I thought he was going to apologize again. Instead, all he said was that he could have got another Jap if his bolt hadn't jammed.</b></td>

"YANK WEEKLY 1 OCT. 1944, MERRILL&#39;S ARTILLERY","By Sgt. DAVE RICHARDSON YANK Staff Correspondent From Yank the Army Weekly British Edition Vol 3. No. 16 Oct. 1 1944
BEHIND JAPANESE LINES IN NORTHERN BURMA.
Jap artillery was pounding Merrill's Marauders again. Three weeks before. the enemy guns had sent shells whistling into Marauder positions facing the Walawbum garrison. Two weeks before. a Jap battery had ranged in on the Marauders during their attack on the enemy supply route at Inkangahtawng. One week before, a couple of rapid-fire guns had hammered the Marauders all night after their capture of a section of the Shaduzup-Kamaing road. And now Jap artillery was concentrated on a unit of Marauders on Nhpum Ga hill. Another Marauder unit was driving through to relieve the outfit the Japs had surrounded. As the 70-mm shell blasts reverberated through the jungles. Maj. Edwin J. Briggs of La Crande, Oreg., CO of the attacking unit, sent for a mule skinner and offered him a new job. S/Sgt. John A. Acker, the mule skinner, was an ex-mineworker from Bessemer, Ala., who had shipped overseas a year before with a pack howitzer outfit. The outfit had gone to New Guinea. After sitting around for months without going into action, Acker and several others grew restless. When a call was made for animal transportation men to join Merrill's Marauders, they volunteered. That was seven months before.
S/Sgt Acker
""Acker,"" said the major, ""I understand you and some of the other mule drivers who used to be in the pack artillery would like to fire some howitzers back at these Japs. Is that right?"" The Alabaman said it was. ""Well, Acker,"" the major grinned, ""this is an emergency. Two 75-mm pack howitzers will be parachuted to us tomorrow. Get two gun crews together and be ready to fire them."" Next day an expectant bunch of mule drivers stood on the airdrop field, watching brilliantly colored parachutes drift lazily down. When the ""parachutes hit the ground, the mule skinners became artillerymen again. They grabbed the dismantled howitzers and went to work assembling them. The guns were brand new and clean of cosmoline. Within two hours they were assembled, dug in on the airdrop field and firing.
Gun Crew
A mile away the Marauder unit that was driving through Jap machine-gun positions along the trail to Nhpum Ga heard the shells whistle overhead. ""What the hell is that?"" one rifleman asked another. ""Jap artillery behind us, too?"" Then a radio message explained that it was Marauder artillery. Soon infantry-directed fire was blasting the strong 'points holding up the rifle platoon. Two days later Acker and his impromptu artillery crews put their howitzers on mules and climbed the winding trail for three miles. They emplaced their guns on a ridge overlooking the Jap positions between the trapped Marauder unit on Nhpum Ga hill and the attacking unit. While the guns were being set up again T-4 Robert L. Carr of San Luis Obispo, Calif., started for the front as artillery observer with a walkie-talkie. The point platoon had run smack up against one of the strongest Jap positions yet. This was a perimeter atop a little knoll from which Jap machine gunners commanded a clear field of fire for several hundred feet down the trail. The steep sides of the knoll made flanking difficult. It would have to be taken frontally. The point platoon asked for artillery and mortar support. Carr, the observer, took his walkie-talkie up to the first squad. ""Jap position approximately 700 yards from guns,"" he radioed, adding the azimuth. 'Fire a smoke shell, and I'll zero you in."" The smoke shell whistled over, followed by a few more as Carr adjusted the firing data. Finally he okayed both range and azimuth. Lacking an aiming circle, the only piece of equipment that was not dropped with the guns, Acker and his men were obliged to use an ordinary infantry compass to gauge azimuth. These mule skinners gave up their mules for a pack howitzer when Merrill's Marauders needed artillery. The order came to fire five rounds. Up ahead all morning there had been constant mortar, machine-gun and small-arms fire. But as soon as the howitzers opened fire, Jap bullets began singing over the artillerymen's heads. All day the Japs reminded Acker's men that they were firing practically point-blank at 700 yards. Just after the howitzers fired the five rounds, S/Sgt. Henry E. Hoot of Shepherd, Tex., radioman with the guns, shouted to Acker: ""Holy smoke! Some Infantry officer is on the radio. He's excited as hell. Says you're right on the target. ""And get this"" he wants us to fire 'Battery 100 rounds'."" There's no such order in artillery parlance; actually the correct order for a lot of firing is ""Fire at will."" Acker chuckled at the order. ""Okay, boys,"" he said. ""Open those shell cases fast. Gun crews, prepare to fire at will."" In the Next 15 minutes, the jungle hills rang as the two pack howitzers threw 134 shells into the Jap perimeter. The crews had been a bit slow two days before because they hadn't seen a howitzer in seven months, but now they performed as artillerymen should. Up front the point platoon drove through They found parts of Jap bodies in trees and all over the ground, virtually blown out of their holes. The dense"" jungle had become a clearing under the terrific blasting. A platoon leader going through the area, a few minutes after the barrage. discovered two shivering Japs deep in a foxhole, unhurt but moaning with fear. He killed them with a carbine. Apparently they were the only ones who had survived and stayed in the area. The platoon moved through unopposed. For the next few days the artillery worked hand in hand with the point platoon in blasting other Jap positions. On one of these days Pvt. John W. (Red) Seegars of Kershaw, S. C.. walked up to the guns with a broad smile. Seegars had been requested by Acker as No. I man on one of the howitzers but because he was a rifleman and was [deeded in the drive, he had not been sent back to the guns. Now Seegars was wounded in the left arm. ""As a rifleman I can't crawl with this arm wound,"" said Seegars, ""so they sent me back to the aid station for evacuation. But I'm not going. I can still pull a howitzer lanyard with my right arm."" Acker was glad to get him. MEANWHILE Carr. the artillery observer, found things pretty hot at the front. On an advance with a ride platoon, he was pinned down on the side of a hill by Jap machine guns and grenades at the top. Two men were wounded near him. He left the radio and dragged each of them back through the fire to an aid man. Returning to his radio, Carr egged the Japs into revealing their positions by throwing grenades, thus drawing fire on himself. Then he radioed the howitzers to shorten their range and swing their azimuth until the shells burst near a Jap heavy machine gun 30 yards away. All this time, a Jap dual-purpose antiaircraft gun was throwing 70-mm shells into the midst of the trapped Marauder unit on Nhpum Ga hilt Acker got a liaison plane to spot the ack-ack gun's position. Then the howitzers fired on it all day. At dusk the Jap gun- tried to fire back at the howitzers, but its trajectory was too flat to hit them. The shells either hit an intervening hill or whistled harmlessly high over the artillerymen's heads.
And that morning the Marauder attacking unit broke through to relieve the unit that had been cut off by the Japs for 10 days. Acker and his men, mule skinners no more, fired a salvo to celebrate.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/back.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_yank3.gif"" /><br /></p>

"YANK WEEKLY 17 SEPT. 1944, MARAUDER MAGIC","By Sgt. DAVE RICHARDSON YANK Staff Correspondent From Yank the Army Weekly British Edition Vol. 3, No. 14, Sept. 17 1944
BEHIND JAPANESE LINES IN NORTHERN BURMA .
There's been plenty of hocus-pocus in this jungle war ever since Merrill's Marauders first popped up here. The magic show started within a week of the Marauders' arrival in Burma. The night before their first sneak around Jap strong points, a Jap reconnaissance plane droned over the Marauders' bivouac area. Before they could stamp out all their campfires, the plane had spotted the position. Next morning, when the Marauders pulled out Brig. Gen. Frank D. Merrill ordered a few men to stay behind. For several nights they lit campfires in the original bivouac area. And each night the Jap plane returned to circle the area again, its pilot apparently satisfying himself that whoever was camped there hadn't moved. Meanwhile the main body of Marauders marched steadily into enemy territory over little used native trails, lighting no fires or even cigarettes after dark. When they finally bumped into startled enemy outposts, they were well behind Jap lines. The Marauders opened their bag of tricks again during an eight-day battle on a hill named Nhpum Ga. One night a Marauder unit set up part of its perimeter only a stone's throw *am camouflaged Jap machine-gun positions. Anxious to check on the location of these emplacements, but not wanting to risk men prowling around in the darkness, the Marauders shoved a pack mule out in front of the perimeter and started him walking toward the Japs. As the animal rustled through the jungle underbrush, the Japs figured it was a patrol and opened up with their machine guns, thereby revealing their positions. Next morning the Marauders outflanked the Jap pocket and wiped it out. They found the mule lying dead a few feet from one of the machine guns, its hind quarters neatly butchered. The hungry Japs, cut off from supplies, had eaten Missouri mule steak before dying for the Emperor. Speaking of animals, the Japs thought up a slick way to guard themselves against Marauder booby traps along the narrow jungle trails. They sent dogs down the trails ahead of their patrols to trip the booby-trap wires. But a Marauder pioneer and demolition platoon countered this move by rigging up the traps in relays. After that, when a Jap dog romped down a trail a dozen yards or so in front of a patrol and tripped a booby-trap wire, nothing happened to the dog, but traps exploded at intervals all the way back down the hill, killing or wounding some of the enemy. Even after the Japs discovered this trick, there was little they could do about it they had to stick to jungle trails or risk getting lost. The Marauders smoked tell-tale cigarettes, talked in loud voices and jiggled the mule saddles. The old power of suggestion helped beat the Japs at another stage of the campaign. for several days the Marauders had been trying to break through a pocket of Japs dug in strongly on a razor-backed ridge along the only trail in the area. The steep sides of the ridge made outflanking next to impossible. The only way to get through was by frontal attack, and this was costing the Marauders a number of casualties. They pounded away with mortars, raked the ridge with machine guns and BARB, and staged one attack after another. But the going was painfully slow a few yards a day. One night the Marauders decided to try another method. A few men and mules set out on the trail leading up to Marauder forward positions from the rear. The men smoked tell-tale cigarettes, talked in loud voices and jiggled the mule saddles to make plenty of noise. Each time they reached the front, the men doused their cigarettes, turned around and silently withdrew to their starting points. Then they began all over again, keeping it up for three hours. When the Marauders attacked the ridge again the next day, they pushed through easily. Only a couple of Japs were still there; the rest had pulled out. They had been fooled into thinking that all the noise and movement of the night before were reinforcements for a big attack. One of the most valuable tricks in the Marauder repertoire was a variation of the Statue of Liberty play in football. It was used in attacking a series of Jap strong points on high ground. The CP long-range radio called for air support to soften up the Jap hill positions. Soon some P-40s came roaring over. Directed by air-ground radio, they went to work on the Japs, dive-bombing and strafing enemy emplacements on the crest of the hill. After each pass they zoomed up, circled around and attacked again. The Japs scrambled down the back of the hill and huddled there for protection while the bombs and tracers chewed up their positions. But as soon as the planes finished their dives and roared away, the Japs crawled right back up the hill again and resisted the Marauder advance as stubbornly as before. This went on for several days, with the Japs defending one hill after another in the same way against air and ground attack. All that beautiful air support didn't seem to help much. Then a Marauder officer suggested the Statue of Liberty play. He radioed the planes to make a few fake passes after they had completed their regular bombing and strafing runs. The pilots dived their ships at the emplacements just as though they were going to let loose with 500 pound bombs or .50 caliber slugs, but they pulled out without doing a thing except scare the hell out of the Japs. Up the hill came the unsuspecting Japs to reoccupy their old positions. As soon as the planes began these passes, the forward Marauder platoon rushed up the hill and climbed into the vacated Jap positions. When the dummy passes ended and the planes went away, the fun began. Up the hill came the unsuspecting Japs to reoccupy their positions. The Marauders cut them down with automatic-weapons fire.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/back.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_yank3.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/next.gif"" /></p>

"YANK WEEKLY 24 JUNE 1944, OF MULES & MEN","Yank The Army Weekly-CBI-EditionJune 24 1944-Vol. 1 No 47 By Sgt. Dave Richardson
Yank Staff Correspondent.
OF MULES AND MEN.
BEHIND JAPANESE LINES IN NORTHERN BURMA-Odds and ends from the battered diary of a footsore YANK Correspondent after his first 500 miles of marching and Jap-hunting with Merrill's Marauders:
WELL-FITTED: SUCH specialists as clerks and radiomen were pressed into service as mule-drivers with the Marauders to make up for a shortage of experienced animal men. Leading, feeding, watering and grooming the mules turned out to be one of the toughest jobs in the raider outfit. Passing through the pick-line after a day's march Brig.-Gen. Frank D Merrill came across a sweating grimy-faced mule-driver tenderly combing a mule's back. ""You certainly seem to take good care of your animal,"" remarked General Merrill. ""Had much experience with mules in the states?"" The soldier, Pfc. Casey Turiello, turned his weary face. ""No, sir,"" he said. ""But I did see a mule once--on an ice wagon back home in Brooklyn."" PARTNERS IN MISERY:
ANOTHER mule-driver was having trouble with his animal. It balked at the bottom of a very rugged Burma hill. The driver had to coax, cajole, cuss and tug at his animal constantly.

The lives ones now around us Soon we will join the rest When Tojo gave his orders To kill us one by one, He didn't know Merrill's Marauders would sink the rising sun. (Benson took a slight poetic license in his first line. Actually the Marauders are credited with killing only 2,000 Japs in six weeks.)

Oh, Governor-General of Australia and South America, Only Japan sweet odor of fragrant blossoms permeates. When I die I'll call together all the devils, And wrestle them in a three-inch rivulet.

Usually these messages were ""The column is broken behind the __ platoon."" or ""Lost contact with the mule train."" Occasionally however, a new wording crept in to cause confusion. One of these new wordings was contained in a message passed up one rainy night on a forced march through enemy-infested jungles. ""There's a gap in the column."" was the way it started. When it reached the front of the column, however, it had changed to ""there's a Jap in the column."" T front, unperturbed, sent back word to throw him out.

<p>OF MULES AND MEN.</p>
<p>BEHIND JAPANESE LINES IN NORTHERN BURMA-Odds and ends from the battered diary of a footsore YANK Correspondent after his first 500 miles of marching and Jap-hunting with Merrill's Marauders:</p>
<p><b>WELL-FITTED:          SUCH specialists as clerks and radiomen were pressed into service as mule-drivers with the Marauders to make up for a shortage of experienced animal men. Leading, feeding, watering and grooming the mules turned out to be one of the toughest jobs in the raider outfit.          Passing through the pick-line after a day's march Brig.-Gen. Frank D Merrill came across a sweating grimy-faced mule-driver tenderly combing a mule's back.          ""You certainly seem to take good care of your animal,"" remarked General Merrill. ""Had much experience with mules in the states?""          The soldier, Pfc. Casey Turiello, turned his weary face. ""No, sir,"" he said. ""But I did see a mule once--on an ice wagon back home in Brooklyn."" PARTNERS IN MISERY:</b></p>

"THE N.Y. DAILY NEWS 05 AUGUST 1944","GEN. STILWELL'S HQ. IN INDIA, AUG. 5 (AP) ""An almost complete breakdown of morale"" of Merrill's Marauders, one of the most famous American combat organizations was disclosed today by Army authorities, who blamed ""ill-advised promises"" to the men and faulty hospital procedure which sent convalescents back to the firing line. The difficulty arose at the end of May, when the American position at Myitkyina was precarious, but for security reasons it was disclosed only today following the capture of the Japanese base in Burma. As a result of an official inquiry ordered by Lieut. Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, it was recommended that they be placed in favored position for rotation transfers to the United States. ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. The Marauders' leader, Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill, although occupied with directing one phase of the Burma operations, visited the units where disaffection was evident and gathered all available information. Gen. Stilwell wept when he heard that recall of several hundred of the men to active service when physically unfit had resulted from a misunderstanding of his orders that all possible able-bodied personnel be thrown into action. (A dispatch Saturday from Southeast Asia Command Headquarters at Kandy, Ceylon, describing the fall of Myitkyina to Chinese and American combat engineers on Thursday, said the assault forces was directed by Brig. Gen. T. F. Wessels, succeeding Gen. Merrill who had been given a more restful assignment. The Kandy dispatch made no mention of the Marauders.) The official report attaches no blame either to medical officers or combat leaders, but says return of unfit men to combat was due to a misunderstanding at a time when the bottom of the barrel was being scraped for manpower to hold the Myitkyina air base against Japanese counterattacks. The Marauders are all volunteers. Some had seen service in the Solomon Islands and elsewhere in the Pacific. They were recruited as a special unit and partly as a result of ""ill-advised promises,"" believed that they would be sent home and disbanded after one spectacular mission in Burma. The Marauders surprised the Japanese and seized the Myitkyina airfield and apparently were convinced that this was the operation for which they had been formed. They remained in action, however, and the report stated that ""the resultant feeling on the part of individuals was that they were being double-crossed."" By June 1, the Marauders had been in action about three months and were suffering from malaria, exhaustion, and malnutrition, the report noted and their feeling resulted ""in almost complete breakdown of moral."" Southeast Asia Command HQ., Kandy, Ceylon, Aug. 5 (AP). - Thrusting quickly across the Irrawaddy River from captured Myitkyina, Lieut. Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell's Chinese troops have taken two-thirds of Waingmaw, it was announced tonight. Stilwell himself said no Japanese were known to remain between his Burma forces and the Chinese fighting westwards in Yunnan Province.

"THE NEW YORK TIMES 17 MAY 1944","MERRILL'S RAIDERS MAKE WAR RECORD
Men In North Burma Have Marched Farther Fought More Than Any Other Of U.S.
By TILLMAN DURDIN
By Wireless to The New York Times WITH CHINESE - AMERICAN FORCES AT MYITKYINA, in Burma, May 17 (Delayed). For Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill's American Raider detachment this week's attack on Myitkyina is the climax to four months of marching and combat in Burma jungles. No other American force except the First Marine Division, which took and held Guadalcanal for four months, has had as much uninterrupted jungle fighting service as Merrill's Raiders. No other American force anywhere has marched as far, fought as continuously or has had to display such endurance, as General Merrill's swift-moving, hard-hitting foot soldiers. When the Americans attacked Myitkyina they had behind them 800 miles marching over jungle and mountain roads and tracks. They had already fought four major engagements and since early March had been in almost daily combat with large and small Japanese forces, Before the Burma Raiders had reached Myitkyina they had killed more than 2,000 Japanese for losses to themselves of only a fraction of this number. RAIDERS STARTED IN FEBRUARY A specially organized detachment made up of men who had volunteered for the jobs out of units who had seen service in the Solomons and New Guinea or who had received special training in jungle warfare in the Caribbean area. Merrill's Raiders set out for their grueling assignment from Ledo in Assam early in February. After a three weeks' march over the Naga Hills and into the Hukawng Valley the Raiders made a wide sweep around the Japanese flank at Maingkwan and stabbed into the rear of the enemy at Walawbum. Establishing themselves across the road, the Americans slaughtered more than 600 Japanese who sought to escape southward from the frontal attacks and flanking thrust of Lieut. Gen. Joseph W Stiwell's Chinese forces north of Walawbum. The Raiders then set out through the steaming forest of the Hukawng Valley for there next engagement. Part of the Raiders, under Lieut. Col. William Osborne of Los Angeles, Teamed with a Chinese detachment, climbed through the mountains at the south end of Hukawng Valley east of the main road, fighting small groups of Japanese all the way, and established a road block far in the Japanese rear at Laban near Shaduzup, forty miles south of Walawbum. After inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese, paving the way for another advance of General Stiwell's main forces, Colonel Osborne's men withdrew. BIG OUTFLANKING MARCH Meanwhile the rest of the Raiders under General Merrill made a prodigious outflanking left end march of seventy miles in three days, most of the way over rugged timbered mountains and set another road block at Inkangatawng, fifteen miles south of Shaduzup. armed and organized only for hit and run blows, General Merrill's force withdrew after twenty-four hours when the Japanese produced overwhelming strength against them. Pulling back into the hills, closely pursued by a Japanese column that had the assignment of making a Merrill-style raid of its own against General Stiwell's forces north of Shaduzup, a battalion of General Merrill's men stood at Npum Ga, and engaged the enemy column. Here a fourteen-day battle was fought, the fiercest the Raiders had up to the time of the Myitkyina attack. At one stage the battalion was surrounded by Japanese and pounded with artillery, but other Raider units broke through and relieved their comrades. The Japanese force was virtually annihilated and the enemy's plans were shattered. After a few days of reorganization and integration with Chinese units, Merrill's Raiders set out for their biggest job, the assault on Myitkyina. GAUNT ON SCANT RATIONS Lean, gaunt bodies, bearded faces and hollow eyes tell the story of the physical drain their terrific jungle campaign has been for the Raiders. Most of the time they have lived on standard K rations, little packaged meals of tinned cheese, ham and eggs, pork, chocolate, fruit bars and crackers. Occasionally at rest stages they have been stationary long enough to receive bulkier and more varied foods. All rations and all other supplies have been dropped by planes and this has enabled the Merrill forces to go anywhere with out regard for an overland line of communications.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/b_news.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/next.gif"" /></p>

"Merrill&#39;s Marauders - Col. Weston Biogrophy","Born January 5, 1914, Logan was one of five children and spent his childhood moving with his family every couple of years - Ohio to Michigan to Idaho to Pennsylvania - and back again. During the Great Depression, Logan drooped out of school in the eighth grade to help the family try to make ends meet by working odd jobs - milking cows, sweeping floors, helping farmers with crops and livestock. When he got older Logan found work in a mine, a sawmill, and as an electrical appliance repairman, at the same time he attended night school to make up for the education that he had missed. In 1939 at the age of 25 Logan enrolled in the first class of the new Transylvania Bible School where he was the oldest of nine students, four men and five women. While in his junior year Logan received his orders to report for induction into U.S. Army on January 3, 1941, just 2 days short of his 27th birthday.
Logan began his basic training and military career by being assigned to H Company (Heavy Weapons) of the 145th Regiment of the 37th Infantry Division at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. After almost a year of training on December 7, 1941 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor the unit was ordered out of Camp Shelby and assigned to guard against sabotage at strategic points along the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. It was during this time that Logan began his rapid rise in the enlisted ranks to the rank of Staff Sergeant. In January 1942 the Unit shipped out of San Francisco, aboard the ship Uruguay, on there way to their first overseas assignment, the Fijian Islands.
While on the Fijian Islands the 37th Divisions job was to set up coastal defenses and to patrol the islands looking for Japanese radio relay stations that where reporting on allied shipping and troop movements in the area. In January 1943 the 37th received new orders to move to Guadalcanal. Just before receiving these orders Logan was given a battle field commission to the rank of Second Lieutenant. Logan led his company onto Guadalcanal to secure the beach for the rest of the battalion, following close behind. On Guadalcanal the unit was used mainly for patrol duty in the mopping up of the Japanese. While on one of these patrols, Logan had his first face to face encounter with the enemy and recorded his first three enemy kills. On July 3, 1943 the unit was on it's way to New Georgia Island. The unit was suppose to spearhead the assault on New Georgia Island along with the Marines and again Logan's company was chosen the lead the Battalion ashore. But while preparing to load aboard the landing crafts, the ship they where on was hit and every one had to abandon ship, it was going down fast. Swimming to other landing craft and boats Logan's company made it ashore and established a beach head. Only about one third of the battalion made it ashore, the rest being driven back out to sea by the heavy enemy fire. It took a day of grueling fighting before the rest of the unit made it ashore and the beachhead began to expand. During the ensuing battle for the heavily defended island of New Georgia, Logan's battalion was twice surrounded by the Japanese once for over 30 days at a place they called starvation ridge, fighting a blocking action they survived by eating whatever eatable vegetation they could find and dried rice taken from the dead enemy troops, with only the rain water they could collect in their canteen cups to drink. After the battle for New Georgia the unit moved back to Guadalcanal for rest and refitting.
37th Division
After only 3 days back on Guadalcanal a call for volunteers for a secret, dangerous and hazardous mission was sounded. Logan and a lot of his men answered the call. Within 24 hours they found them selves on a boat bound for New Caledonia. Once they arrived in New Caledonia they were consolidated and organized, along with volunteers from all divisions who had fought in the South Pacific, into a battalion of combat veterans. After 3 weeks the battalion boarded the ocean liner Lureline which had sailed from San Francisco with two other battalions of volunteers. Now the almost 3,000 volunteers set sail for Bombay India, arriving over a month latter in September 1943. During the long trip Logan and the other combat veterans were used to train the other two battalions in the ways of jungle combat.
During the next four months this unit trained at different sites in India, learning guerilla-type tactics and honing their skills as a unit. The unit was designated the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) and latter became known as Merrill's Marauders, named for its leader Gen. Frank D. Merrill. During this time Logan was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and given the job of Platoon leader for the I & R Platoon of the 3rd battalion. In January of 1944 Marauders moved to Ledo India in preparation of it's mission to spear head the drive into Northern Burma, to clear the way for the building of the Ledo Road, wich would connect with the Burma Road and create a much needed land route to help supply the Chinese. In early February 1944 Logan's I & R Platoon led the Marauders on the march into Burma. While in Burma Logan's I & R Platoon had scouted about twelve hundred and fifty miles of jungle trails. They fought 18 battles, experienced a total of four men killed and five wounded and were estimated to have killed over twelve hundred and sixty enemy soldiers. The whole time in Burma the Marauders were supplied by air drops whenever possible, The unit was most of the time underfed, exhausted and pushed beyond a point believed to be humanly impossible. During the Marauders final battle for the town of Myitkyina Logan was evacuated to a hospital in India after being found in his fox hole passed out, suffering from exhaustion, malnutrition, malaria and hand grenade wounds. After only a couple of weeks in the hospital Logan was sent back to Myitkyina to help with the final mop-up operations. After six more weeks of combat he was again evacuated for battle injuries, At that time there were only a couple of hundred men of the original three thousand Marauders left.
Merrill's Marauders After Several months in the hospital at Ledo India, Logan was ordered back to the states for complete recuperation, the long journey back had finally begun. Once back in the states Logan was assigned to the Infantry Replacement Training Center, at Anniston, Alabama. A couple months later Logan was reassigned to the Infantry Training Center at Fort Benning, Georgia. where he taught officer candidates the tactical concepts he had developed while behind enemy lines in Burma. After World War II came to a close, Logan was sent to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were he received his discharge from active duty as a Captain. He signed on with the inactive reserves an re-enrolled at Transylvania bible school, but because of constant bouts of recurring attacks of malaria, he found it difficult to concentrate on his studies. Logan decided to accept a pastorate at a little Methodist church in southwestern Pennsylvania, and completed his theological degree by correspondence. It was while in this position that he met and married his lovely wife Mary on February 14, 1948 (Valentine's Day). After 3 years Logan finally finished his degree and requested a return to active duty in the hopes of being able to transfer to the Chaplain Corps. March 1948 found Weston back in the service of his country stationed at Fort Mead, Maryland as the Post Information and Education Officer. Weston applied for a transfer to the Chaplain Corps, but due to a technicality his transfer was denied and had to remain in the Infantry. Weston remained at Fort Mead for two years and then in 1950 received new orders to go to Japan. Once in Japan Weston was assigned to be the Company Commander of H-Company, 17th Regiment, 7th Division. H-Company was a machine gun and 81-millimeter mortar company. After six months with H-Company Weston and most of the company were transferred to 25th Division and began to prepare for shipment to Pusan, South Korea to back up the 24th Division, the Korean War had just begun.
7th Division Once in South Korea Weston was sent to a town called Taegu and assumed command of Alpha Company, 27th Regiment, 25th Division (Known as the ""Wolfhounds""). Early in the action while near a town called Masan, Weston was wounded three times (thigh, arm, and chest) as he led his men in blunting an advance by a North Korean assault unit. Weston received the first wound (thigh) while single-handedly he engaged the attackers as his radio man was sent to get help from the rest of the company. His second wound (arm) came as he was directing the company into defensive positions. He then went to the aid station to be patched up and immediately return to the action crawling and dragging a box of fragmentation grenades with him. Weston's third wound, a chest wound, came as he was leading a counter attack on the enemy's flank. Weston bleeding profusely from his chest wound was still able to get on a radio and direct the 4.2in. mortar platoon fire on a column of North Korean reinforcements. With the situation under control Weston organized the wounded and followed them to the aid station where he was evacuated to Pusan with the other wounded men and then sent to Japan for further surgery. The action by Weston and his company was instrumental in halting the advance of the enemy on Pusan. This battle was latter to be called one of the main turning points in the war. For his action in this battle Weston was recommended for a Congressional Medal of Honor, but the regimental commander knocked it down, Weston did however receive the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions.
25th Division After recovering from his wounds in Japan, Weston returned to South Korea in September 1950. Around November 1950 Logan was promoted to Major and assigned to the 27th Regiment as Battalion Plans and Training officer. The United Nation forces were close to total Victory at this time, Weston's battalion was now in the mountains separating North Korea from Manchuria in China. The battalion had set up an outpost near a town called Chinsong-ni overlooking the Yalu River. The battalion was the first unit to be hit when the Communist Chinese forces came streaming across the border. Some of these Chinese Officers and men were the very same men that Weston had fought side by side with while he was in the Merrill's Marauders in Burma fighting the Japanese during WWII. The following months were filled with constant fighting against an overwhelming number of Communist Chinese forces, often involving hand to hand combat. During this time Weston continually distinguished himself in the face of battle against the Chinese forces, and was awarded a Silver Star. The Communist troops were eventually pushed back across the 38th parallel and then unexpectedly Logan received new orders to return to the U.S. It didn't take Weston long to settle into his new assuagement as Commander of a officers training battalion at Fort Benning Georgia, and fill in for a local minister while the minister was away on an extended vacation. Because there was a shortage of chaplains on post he was also aloud to take charge of a chapel on post. During this tour of duty at Fort Benning Weston with a little prodding from his young sons, applied for and was accepted into Jump School at the age of 40 years young. It was while at jump school that Logan received new orders for Germany. While in Germany Logan was assigned various positions, 1st as Associate Trainer (G-3) with the 43rd Infantry Division, then as the Regimental Plans and Training Officers, and finally the Commandant of the Division NCO Academy, before be reassigned back to the U.S. Weston's first assignment back in the states was as a Division Plans and Training Officer at Fort Carson, Colorado. He then was sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to undergo training in an advanced course for field grade officers at the Command and General Staff College. After completion of the advance course Logan was assigned to the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.. This assignment at the Pentagon lasted three years. During this assignment Logan was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel while on an inspection tour of the 101st Airborne Division at Camp Cambell, Kentucky. In 1961 Weston completed 20 years of service in the army and was given a choice to retire or take another assignment, he chose a command position with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
82nd Airborne Division Weston was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division as the Executive Officer of the 325th Battle Group and a few months latter was promoted to the Commanding Officer of the battle group. While with the battle group Logan would often join the group in exhibition jumps. Weston was then ask to join the newly formed Green Berets which he accepted. He then developed the plans for Special Forces Counterinsurgency course. After the fifth class had gone through the course Logan received top secret orders for reassignment to Laos as Special Force Advisor to Military Assistant Advisory Group Laos (MAAGLAO for short).
Green Berets In Laos Logan and the Green Berets job was to advise the neutral Laotian forces on military operations, and to keep headquarters informed on the progress of the Communist North Vietnamese were making on the construction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In performing the second part of their assignment the Green Berets where often placed under attack by the Viet Cong, who where being advised by the Russians. After a period of time Logan and the Green Berets were pulled out of Laos and sent to Bangkok, Thailand. While in Thailand Weston formed a joint Green Berets and Thai forces exhibition jump team, the team would go around Thailand putting on exhibitions and raised enough money to build thirty-two new schools, enlarge four additional schools and equip two hospitals. The building of these schools greatly enhanced the standard of living in these communities and gave the Thai people a sense of community. Due to a family medical emergency Weston asked for and received a transfer to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Logan finished his illustrious military career at Fort Sam Houston and retired in 1968 as a Colonel. Upon retirement from the army Weston took a job at Texas A & M University as the Secretary of the YMCA and Coordinator of Campus Religious Life which he held for 13 years until retiring once again. While at the University Logan completed his Masters and Doctor of Bible Philosophy Degrees. In his retirement Logan spends his time volunteering along with his wife, to man the phone at a Christian counseling service, enjoying his family and the occasional speaking engagement.
""I thank God for the opportunity we have to use our freedom of religion, obtained at so great an expense. I also thank God that allowed me the opportunity to fight for this freedom. Perhaps this is why it means so very much to me. "" (Colonel Logan Weston, U.S. Army Retired)

While in Germany Logan was assigned various positions, 1st as Associate Trainer (G-3) with the 43rd Infantry Division, then as the Regimental Plans and Training Officers, and finally the Commandant of the Division NCO Academy, before be reassigned back to the U.S. Weston's first assignment back in the states was as a Division Plans and Training Officer at Fort Carson, Colorado. He then was sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to undergo training in an advanced course for field grade officers at the Command and General Staff College. After completion of the advance course Logan was assigned to the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.. This assignment at the Pentagon lasted three years. During this assignment Logan was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel while on an inspection tour of the 101st Airborne Division at Camp Cambell, Kentucky. In 1961 Weston completed 20 years of service in the army and was given a choice to retire or take another assignment, he chose a command position with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

<br />
<b>82nd Airborne Division</b> Weston was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division as the Executive Officer of the 325th Battle Group and a few months latter was promoted to the Commanding Officer of the battle group. While with the battle group Logan would often join the group in exhibition jumps. Weston was then ask to join the newly formed Green Berets which he accepted. He then developed the plans for Special Forces Counterinsurgency course. After the fifth class had gone through the course Logan received top secret orders for reassignment to Laos as Special Force Advisor to Military Assistant Advisory Group Laos (MAAGLAO for short).

<br />
<b>Green Berets</b> In Laos Logan and the Green Berets job was to advise the neutral Laotian forces on military operations, and to keep headquarters informed on the progress of the Communist North Vietnamese were making on the construction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In performing the second part of their assignment the Green Berets where often placed under attack by the Viet Cong, who where being advised by the Russians. After a period of time Logan and the Green Berets were pulled out of Laos and sent to Bangkok, Thailand. While in Thailand Weston formed a joint Green Berets and Thai forces exhibition jump team, the team would go around Thailand putting on exhibitions and raised enough money to build thirty-two new schools, enlarge four additional schools and equip two hospitals. The building of these schools greatly enhanced the standard of living in these communities and gave the Thai people a sense of community. Due to a family medical emergency Weston asked for and received a transfer to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Logan finished his illustrious military career at Fort Sam Houston and retired in 1968 as a Colonel. Upon retirement from the army Weston took a job at Texas A &amp; M University as the Secretary of the YMCA and Coordinator of Campus Religious Life which he held for 13 years until retiring once again. While at the University Logan completed his Masters and Doctor of Bible Philosophy Degrees. In his retirement Logan spends his time volunteering along with his wife, to man the phone at a Christian counseling service, enjoying his family and the occasional speaking engagement.

"Merrill&#39;s Marauders - Col. Weston Yank Magazine Artical","Behind Japanese Lines In Northern Burma The crackle of a couple of Nambu light machine guns and the whipsnap of Ariska rifles stopped the single-file column of Merrill's Marauders and sent the men scrambling for cover on both sides of the narrow jungle trail. They had trudged nearly 250 miles in the last four weeks. After marching up 116 miles of the Ledo Road, they had swung wide around the Jap positions that were holding up the Chinese drive in the Hukawng Valley of Northern Burma. They had followed narrow native paths and elephant trails through dense undergrowth and high elephant grass and across dozens of rivers and streams. This was to be the first of their missions as a volunteer raiding outfit behind Jap lines--attacking the enemy rear supply base of Walawbum to force a Jap withdrawal 30 miles northward so the Chinese could push through. The Marauders led by Brig. Gen. Frank D Merrill, who had walked out of Burma with Stilwell two years before, were this afternoon only three miles from their goal. The CO of the unit that had bumped into Jap resistance sent for 1st Lt. Logan E Weston of Youngstown, Ohio. A slim, quet pokerfaced young officer, Weston edged his way through the bush to the CO's side. ""Weston,"" said the CO, ""take your intelligence and reconnaissance platoon across the river and move south to a position near the river bank that will cover us from the Walawbum area when we drive through this village of Langag Ga. on the east bank."" Lt. Weston, like most of the others in this Marauder unit, had fought Japs before. Quitting Transylvania Bible School in Freeport, Pa., midway through his study for the ministry, he had joined the Army. He went to the South Pacific as a squad leader in the 37th Division, he was graduated from OCS in the Fiji's, and then he fought in New Georgia as a platoon leader in the 37th. That's where he picked up a nickname. ""Fightin' Preacher,"" his men called him. As one of his original platoon explained it, ""Lt. Weston continued his bible study in spare moments, but when we got into a scrap with the Japs he was one of the fightingest platoon leaders in the outfit."" In New Georgia the Fightin' Preacher had always made one point clear to his men: he did not like to kill. After each action he got his men aside and said, half-apologetically: ""I'm sorry I had to kill those Japs, fellas, but today it was a case of either my getting them or their getting me."" Lt. Weston's tough, swaggering platoon was a marked contrast to its gentle, mild-mannered leader. Among his men were such veterans as Cpl. Werner Katz of New York, N.Y., who fought with the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War and with the Americal Division on Guadacanal. Katz, a burly first scout, became the first American Infantryman to kill a Jap on the continent of Asia when the platoon had a fleeting brush with a Jap patrol the week before. Then there was Pfc. Norman J. (Chief) Janis, a full-blooded Sioux Indian and former rodeo rider from Deadwood, S. Dak., who thought it was a bad day during the Buna battle in New Guinea if he had to use more than one bullet to kill a Jap. And Sgt. William L Grimes of Lonaconing, Md., who won the Silver Star for knocking off 25 Japs at Quadalcanal. And a couple of dozen others who had battled Japs in the jungles and swamps of the South and Southwest Pacific. They had all volunteered for this ""dangerous and hazardous"" jungle-fighting mission. The Fightin' Preacher's men got to their feet and slung on their 60-pound horseshoe-type packs. They moved through the dark jungle undergrowth down to the muddy little river and crossed it Indian file wading 40 feet to the other side through crotch-deep water. Then, rifles cradled in their arms, they climbed the bank. They rustled their way through the brush alongside the riverbank all afternoon, cautiously covering a few hundred yards. One or twice the scouts spotted Jap sentries and traded a few bullets with them, but the Japs got away. Just before dusk the platoon halted and dug in a perimeter of fox holes to spend the night. They could hear the main body of Marauders pushing through the Jap resistance across the river, using lots of tommy guns and BAR's. The men ate no supper; they had run out of K-rations two days before. (While the Marauders were behind the Jap lines, they were supplied entirely by airdrop and there were never any drops when the men were sneaking close to their objective, because this might reveal their position and strength.) There was nothing for the men to do but decide on the hours of perimeter guard and then curl up in blanket and poncho and go to sleep. By dawn the next morning the Fightin' Preacher's platoon was on the move again. The scouts had located a bend in the river from which the platoon could command a wide field of fire to the south. From here they could cover the main Marauder unit as it pushed down the trail along the opposite bank. The river bend was only 150 yards away from the night perimeter, and the platoon reached it in half an hour in the early-morning fog. They started to dig in at 0700 hours. Half an hour later Pvt. Pete Leitner, a scout from Okeechobee, Fla., was out in front of the perimeter collecting green branches to camouflage his fox hole when a Nambu light machine gun opened up. Leitner was hit in the middle and crumpled to the ground, severely wounded. Before anyone could get his sights on the Jap machine gunner, he ran away through the brush. Sgt. Paul Mathis of Grey Eagle, Minn., platoon guide and Lt. Weston went out and dragged Leitner back to the perimeter. The rest of the men in the platoon got down in their holes and braced themselves for a Jap attack. They didn't have long to wait. Through the brush they spotted tan-uniformed Japs walking toward them at a crouch, some with twigs camouflaging their helmets. The platoon opened up. The Japs hit the ground and fanned out, crawling closer and shooting furiously. The Japs chattered among themselves; some seemed to be giving commands. Then came the hollow snap of knee mortars being discharged behind the Japs. Seconds later the mortar shells exploded in the trees over the Fightin' Preacher's men. After that the mortars were fired in salvoes. ""Five Japs on the right flank!"" somebody yelled. Sgt. John Gately of Woburn, Mass., spotted the first one and killed him. Pfc. Harold Hudson of Bristol, Conn., glimpsed the other four and mowed them all down, starting his tommy gun at the rear of the quartet and working forward. The main Jap attack was coming in the center of the platoon's defense. A squad of Japs moved in closer, crawling and shooting. Grimmes, the Silver Star winner from Guadalcanal, now added to his record of 25 Japs by pumping bullets into each one that lifted his head. T-5 Raymond F Harris of Pekin, Ill., sprayed the squad with his BAR as some of the Japs managed to creep within 30 feet of his position. One Jap shot at Harris just as he ducked his head to put a magazine in his BAR. The bullet dented his helmet. Inside the perimeter, Lt. Weston and his platoon sergeant, T/Sgt. Alfred M Greer of Malden, Mass., got a message from Pfc. Benny Silverman of New York, N.Y., walkie-talkie radioman, that the main body of the Marauders had chased the remaining Japs from the opposite bank of the river and had taken up position there. ""Fine"" the Fightin' Preacher told Greer. ""Let's get them to help us with their mortars."" Acting as mortar observer, Greer got Silverman to radio back a rough estimate of positions based on his map. Soon the crack of a mortar discharge answered from across the river. An 81-mm mortar shell burst with a hollow explosion behind the Japs. Greer gave Silverman new elevation and azimuth figures. Another mortar shell lobbed over. It burst a little closer to the Japs but over to one side. ""Anybody got a compass with mils on it instead of degrees?"" asked Greer. Near him Cpl. Joe Gomez, aid man from Gallup, N. Mex., had just finished working on Sgt. Lionel Parquette of Calumet, Mich., who was mortally wounded in the head. Gomez opened a pouch at his belt and handed his compass over to Greer. ""We medics got everything,"" he grinned. Greer told the mortars to lay in a smoke shell and he took an azimuth reading on it. Then he gave Siverman a new set of figures to radio the mortar crew. Across the river, the mortar chief--1st Lt. William F Woomer of State Collage, Pa., called ""Woomer the Boomer"" in New Guinea--shouted the figure to the mortar crew. Sgt. Edwin Kopec of Lowell, Mass.; Pvt. James McGowan of West Newton, Mass., and Pvt. Wise Alderman of Floyd, Va., set the figures on the scales and lobbed over another one. Theirs was the only mortar in position to fire across the river. Another mortar crew was changing it's position to clear some trees with its trajectory. Soon with Greer's observation, the mortars were right on their target. Greer then varied the figures every few rounds to cover the Japs from the flank. ""Nice going boys,"" he yelled after a series of six burst. ""We just saw a couple of Japs blown out of their holes 40 yards from our point man."" As fast as the mortarmen could rip open shell cases, they poured fire across the river. The Japs kept coming. They edged into position on three sides of the perimeter and were even trying to get between the river and the Fightin' Preacher's platoon. Their machine-gun and rifle fire increased in intensity and volume. Lt. Weston estimated about a company Japs was opposing him. Then Silverman at the walkie-talkie got an order for the platoon to withdraw to the other side of the river. Its mission had been accomplished. There was no use staying to fight the Japs with such a small force when the main body of Marauders was moving south to make a direct attack on Walawbum. Greer, Siverman and a couple of others made litters out of bamboo poles and buttoned-up fatigue jackets to carry the few wounded who could not walk. Then, under cover of Lt. Woomer's mortar fire, the platoon withdrew to the river and prepared to cross. The Japs followed, figuring on catching them in the riverbed. Across the river four BAR's opened up to cover the crossing. The bullets whined over the platoon's heads. Lt. Weston told Silverman to radio back that the Japs were on the flanks waiting to knock off some men crossing the river. Then two of the platoons peeled off their white undershirts and put one in a tree on each flank of the platoon to serve as firing guides for the BAR's. Just before crossing, Lt. Weston ordered the mortars to throw smoke shells to the rear and flanks of the withdrawing platoon to screen the move. One by one the men of the platoon splashed back across the river as BAR's stuttered away and mortar burst echoed down the riverbed. After Chief Janis, the Indian crack shot, had crossed, he turned to watch Pfc. John E. Clark of Windsor, Vt., and Katz, the International Brigade veteran, carry the wounded Leitner across on a litter. Out of the corner of his eye, Janis spotted a movement in the bushes on the bank. A Jap with a light machine-gun had parted the bushes and was taking aim at the litter-bearers and their burden. Janis raised his M1 and fired two shots. The Jap squealed and slumped over his gun. ""I just wanted to make sure I got him,"" said Janis, explaining the extra shot. His score for the day was seven Japs. Meanwhile the BAR men covering the withdrawal were busy. Japs seemed to pop up all over the riverbank. Pvt. Bob Cole of Englewood, Calif., got six of them, and T-5 Clyde Shields of Egg Harbor, Wis., saw two roll down the bank in his sights At 0930 hours the last man withdrew. The sweating mortarmen were ripping open their 113th shell case when the cease-fire order came. Lt. Weston trudged wearily into the unit CP, head bent as he worked the bolt on his carbine. One of his men watched him with obvious admiration. ""You know"" he said ""the Fightin' Preacher got at least two Japs before we withdrew. I thought he was going to apologize again. Instead, all he said was that he could have got another Jap if his bolt hadn't jammed.","<td><br />

"YANK WEEKLY 2 JULY 1944, THE DEAD END KIDS","By Sgt. DAVE RICHARDSON - YANK Staff Correspondent
(from Yank the Army Weekly British Edition Vol 3. No. 3) July 2 1944
BEHIND JAPANESE LINES IN NORTHERN BURMA .
Things were a little too quiet, even for a Sunday. After all. there should have been some fireworks by now. considering that part of the Jap 18th Division was dug in on one side of the muddy 40-foot-wide Nambyu River and our unit of Merrill's Marauders was on the other. ""Looks to me,"" observed a BAR man as he stripped his gun for cleaning, ""like the lull before the storm. The Japs won't take this lying down."" He didn't know how right he was. The Marauders had just completed a 75-mile end run around enemy positions in the Hukawng Valley and now our unit was only 200 yards from Walawbum. We had met only small resistance from Jap patrols during our march. But surely the Japs would stand and fight us here. The native village of Walawbum was the bottleneck through which all supplies had to flow to their front-line troops, 15 miles to the north. Across the river from us was a pretty tough bunch of Japs. We could hear their trucks pulling up, and every once in a while we could spot a few of them for a fleeting instant as we moved through the dense jungle. These were the Japs who had smashed their way into Singapore two years before and now had succeeded in slowing the Chinese drive down this valley to a measly 10-mile gain in the last month. They were fighting a stubborn delaying action from well-chosen positions, falling back from foxhole to foxhole, pillbox to pillbox. On our side of the river were some Marauders known as the Dead End Kids. This was an appropriate nickname for this unit of Brig. Gen. Frank D. Merrill's volunteer American raiders. They had already fought the Japs in the jungles of Guadalcanal, New Guinea and New Georgia. They had joined the Marauders after President Roosevelt had issued a call to their outfits for volunteers for an ""extremely hazardous"" jungle fighting mission in another theater. ""Most of us guys volunteered,"" one of them explained, 'because we figured we might get back to the States for training first. We had all been overseas 18 to 24 months at that time and we wanted to get home. Don't get the idea that we volunteered just because we were itching to fight the Japs again."" I would have believed that statement if I hadn't heard Brig. Gen. Merrill say, a few hours earlier, that the Dead End Kids had been begging all day for permission to attack Walawbum. And if I hadn't come to know them in training camp. The-Dead End Kids wound up in India for training instead of in the States. At Christmas time they went AWOL in droves, popping up in several Indian cities to spend wads of dough that had been useless during their months in the Pacific jungles. When they returned to camp, broke but happy. they were reduced to privates. But they didn't give a damn. They hated the GI routine of garrison life, standing formations and inspections, shooting on the ranges and going on field problems. They broke- the monotony by disappearing alone into the woods and shooting deer, then bringing back the venison for a change of chow. On training problems with other Marauder units, most of whom were proud of their preparation for combat in the jungles of Panama. Trinidad or Puerto Rico, the Dead End Kids confused and harassed their make-believe enemy with screwball tactics they had picked up while fighting the Japs. At night they would sit around their tents and bitch about ""parade-ground soldiering"" or reminisce about their fighting exploits. ""Combat,"" as one of them put it, seems to seduce a guy. He's scared as hell while he's in it, but get him back in garrison and he'll start longing for those foxholes and shellings and bombings."" This Sunday afternoon the Dead End Kids had patrols out across the river to the north and south of Walawbum. As the patrols returned, they reported that the Japs were digging artillery and mortars into position and bringing up truckloads of men and ammunition from the south. But the night was just as peaceful as the day had been. Next morning at 0930 hours, Sgt. Andrew B. Pung of Maiden, Mass., a mortar observer. shinnied up a tree to a perch 40 feet above the river from which he could look down across a grassy clearing on the other bank. Pung had a walkie-talkie radio with him. Soon he reported seeing some telephone wires and several emplacements at the edge of the grassy clearing. Then his routine report changed to an excited one. He forgot all about radio etiquette. ""Listen, he blurted into the microphone, There's a bunch of Japs coming out of the jungle and into this grass across the river. A big bunch. Get ready for an attack. I'll tell you when they're near enough to open fire."" The Dead End Kids jumped into their holes all along the riverbank. Bullets were clicked into chambers and machine-gun bolts pulled back twice to cock them. Pung sent firing data to the mortars as crews ripped open shell cases. Minutes ticked by. There was a tense silence. GIVE it to em, yelled Pung from his perch. The Japs had crossed the clearing to within 35 yards of the opposite riverbank. They were now in plain sight. Machine guns, BARB, mortars and rifles opened up in a deafening deluge of fire. Shrieks and yells came back from the field. Then the Japs began returning the fire. Their 90-mm mortar shells soared over the river and burst in trees behind the Dead End Kids. Shrapnel and bullets hummed through the brush. Up in the tree some of the lead knocked off Pung's canteen and splattered all around him. He dropped the walkie-talkie and shinnied down. The Dead End Kids were dug in on a bluff along the riverbank, a couple of dozen feet higher than the grassy clearing on the opposite bank where the Japs were advancing in spread-out skirmisher formation. This high ground was natural cover; the Japs were firing into the bluff or high over the Marauders' heads. The Americans just lay in their holes and blasted away. Wave after wave of Japs poured out of the jungle and into the clearing, running and diving and creeping and crawling. Many of them carried machine guns and ammunition boxes. Some, probably the officers and noncoms, yelled "" Susume! Susume!"" which means ""advance."" Others shrieked ""Banzai,"" the familiar battle cry. In a few minutes Jap bodies lay sprawled on the field in little bunches. The Dead End Kids could hear the wounded crying and moaning. But the Japs kept coming, at least a company of them. The Dead End Kids were happy They yelled at their machine gunners and BAR men to ""Mow down that bunch over there boy!"" and then shouted ""Atta boy,"" as they concentrated their rifle fire on single targets. Pfc. George Fisher Jr of Napoleon, Ohio, spit a gob of tobacco juice every time his M1 got a Jap. ""Those little bastards must think we're amateurs at this jungle-fighting stuff."" grinned 1st Lt. Victor J. (Able) Weingartner of St. Albans N. Y., commanding the platoon in the center of the American positions along the riverbank ""Banzai charges might :leave terrified the civilian. fans in Singapore, but they're nothing but good moving target practice for us."" Lt. Weingartner was considered one of the most daring leaders of Dead End Kid patrols. Characteristically, he insisted on wearing into action the same dirty mechanic's cap that brought him through New Georgia unscathed, he willingly-paid a $100 fine for not Wearing a helmet at the last showdown inspection before the Marauders started their 200-mile march into battle. Half an hour after the Jap attack began, it halted abruptly. But the Dead End Kids knew that the Japs would try again. Almost as soon as the attack ended. Jap artillery boomed several hundred yards back in the jungle. The shells whistled overhead and landed a half-mile behind the Americans, near a rice paddy. This field had been used in the previous two days as a landing area for Piper Cubs evacuating a few wounded, and as a dropping area for transport planes supplying the Marauders with rations and ammunition. Jap mortars threw a few shells into the American positions the rest of the morning. In the afternoon the good news came that another unit of Marauders had thrown a road block on the main enemy supply route from Walawbum to the front. With Walawbum threatened by the Dead End Kids' position and with the supply route blocked, the stubborn Jap defenses 15 miles northward had collapsed. As the Japs streamed back to reinforce the Walawbum garrison, the Chinese began driving through to relieve the Marauders and make a large-scale attack. As a hit-and-run raider outfit. the Marauders were supposed to keep their positions only until relieved by Chinese divisions with the men, and large weapons needed to do the main attacking. The Chinese were expected within 24 hours. But a lot could happen in 24 hours. The Dead End Kids cleaned their guns, opened more ammunition and placed men every three or four feet along the riverbank. While they worked they could hear the Japs digging, driving up more trucks full of men and ammunition and wheeling in their artillery closer. At 1645 hours the broiling Burma sun had sunk low in the sky. It glared into the faces of the Dead End Kids as they kept their eyes focused on the field across the river. The attack would have to come from the field again because the terrain was unsuitable at other places along the river, where the banks were too high or the jungle too dense for a field of fire. And it came. Two Jap heavy machine guns hammered away like woodpeckers from the flanks of the field. Artillery and mortar fire increased Knee mortars started clicking out grenades at close range. The Japs really attacked this time. They came in waves that were wider and more frequent than the first attack. And they had better support from weapons of all kinds, placed nearer the river. In each wave were several two-man teams lugging heavy machine guns. As soon as one team was hit, another ran out and grabbed its gun, only to die within a few steps. Again the machine gunners and BAR men did most of the killing for the Marauders. They raked each wave with fire. But the Japs surged on across the field until they fell. A few of them even reached the river before they were hit. but nobody crossed. This time there was at least a battalion of Japs attacking the Dead End Kids. And this time the Japs were more accurate with their fire. Bullets sped only a few feet over the Americans heads. Practically every leaf and every tree was marked by the fire. Some of the stuff barely cleared the bank and did some damage. Bullets smashed two BAR magazines on the bank of the foxhole where T-5 Bernard Strasbaugh of Lewisburg, Kans. was stretched. An other bullet nicked his helmet. Strasbaugh was in the center of the attack, firing as fast as he could shove magazines into his weapon. When he spotted five Japs in a group running toward a dropped machine gun. he stood up. riddled them with fire and flopped down again. He hit the ground just soon enough to escape a burst of fire. , ""All a guy has to do to get a Purple Heart here is stand up for 10 seconds,"" he muttered. Pfc. Clayton E. Hall of Strawn. Tex., had a close call at his machine gun on the right flank. A knee-mortar shell burst only three yards in front of him. Then two bullets pierced the water jacket on his gun. With his machine-gun corporal Joseph Diorio of Cleveland, Ohio, Hall managed to keep the gun going by pouring water into the jacket from every available canteen. He burned his hands on the red-hot jacket doing it. but the gun fired 4.000 rounds in 45 minutes. Back at the Dead End Kids' CP. Maj. L. L. Lew of Baker, Oreg.. the unit commander, received a message saying that the Chinese would relieve his unit around midnight. It was then 1730 hours. The Dead End Kids were running low on ammunition. Men started shouting back and forth above. the din ""Hey, you got a spare clip of M1?"" From the left flank came a request for every available hand grenade. A unit there, commanded by Maj. Edwin J. Briggs of La Grande? Greg., was being attacked by Japs who had infiltrated through the jungles from the south. As ammunition ran out, the tension increased. Dusk turned to darkness, but the Jeeps still fired furiously and attacked fanatically. Their bullet riddled bodies littered the field from the edge of the jungle to the river. The wounded screamed. Then, as suddenly as the morning attack had ceased, the dusk battle halted. Both sides stopped firing. The silence was broken by a Dead End Kid who rose to his feet on the river bank. cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled: ""Come on. you little bastards. Come and get your lead!""
A Jap yelled back. The tension was broken. To a man? the Dead End Kids scrambled to their feet, stood along the riverbank and shouted cuss words at the Japs. From the other bank came only a few bursts of light machine-gun fire. The Japs, too, must have run out of ammunition.
Now they removed their wounded from the field in the dark. The Americans could hear the wooden sound of litters being carried through the brush and the terrifying cries of the wounded as they disappeared in the jungle. Among the Dead End Kids. thanks to the natural protection of the high riverbank and to the dug-in emplacements, there had been only three casualties all day. But several pack mules, which carried mortars, radios and ammunition, had been wounded or killed by mortar shells. The little remaining ammunition was doled out equally. A patrol from Maj. Briggs' outfit south of the Dead End Kids brought up some more BAR and machine-gun ammunition. At 2000 hours T/Sgt. Jim Ballard of Spokane, Wash., chief of the unit radio section, entered the perimeter, leading a mule pack train loaded with all kinds of ammunition. He had tried to contact Brig. Gen. Merrill's CP early in the attack, but couldn't get it on the radio. So he had taken Maj. Lew's message requesting more ammunition and run back four miles to another Marauder unit over a dark trail flanked by Jap patrols and through Jap shelling part of the way. He brought back the ammunition mule train through an even more severe shelling. The hours dragged on and a heavy fog set in. A few Japs had sneaked across the river and were booby trapping trails in the vicinity. Across the river the Japs seemed to be getting reinforcements and ammunition again for another attack. While some of the men peered through the mist at the field across the river, others dozed off in their foxholes, with their heads propped on horseshoe-type packs. The Dead End Kids weren't cocky or swaggering tonight: they were exhausted from the tension of the two attacks. Finally the expected message came: ""Withdraw at 0200 hours to join Marauder CP. Chinese are taking over your position. The weary Dead End Kids put on their packs and moved silently Indian-file out of their perimeter with their pack mules. A little way down the trail another column passed the Americans, going in the opposite direction. It was the Chinese. Megwaw, ting hao' they grinned as they plodded past the Dead End Kids. They meant: ""Americans are okay."" A Chinese divisional commander later put it another way: ""Your unit.' he said: ""made it possible for us to gain more ground in one week than we covered all last month."" One of the Dead End Kids, after returning the Chinese greeting, turned and said to the man behind him: You know, I could almost kiss those guys, they look so good to me now."" He wasn't the only one who felt that way. Next morning an official report reached Merrill's Marauders that one of their units, as the first American infantrymen to fight a battle on the continent of Asia, had left 800 Japanese dead on the field near Walawbum. Hearing this, a cocky, swaggering bunch of Americans swung along the jungle trail toward an area where they could rest for two days before going on another mission behind Jap lines. The Dead End Kids were back in their element.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/back.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_yank3.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/next.gif"" /></p>

"RANGERS HOF CITATIONS","Major General Frank D. Merrill is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary valor and outstanding leadership as commander of the 5307th Composite Unit, known as Merrill's Marauders. General Merrill took command of the Marauders in January 1944, with the mission of marching deep into the jungles of Burma behind Japanese lines to cut off enemy communications and supplies. General Merrill led the Marauders, over steep mountains to outflank the Japanese to block their retreat from Shadazup, which the Marauders later captured. The Marauders, many stricken by malaria, typhus and other dreaded diseases, marched 112 miles over mud slogged mountain trails as high as 6000 feet defeating the enemy twice enroute to the daring seizure of an enemy airfield and garrison at Myitkyina. Following World War II General Merrill served as Chief of Staff of the Western Defense Command, and later served as Chief of Staff and as Commander of the 6th Army. In 1947 he became deputy Chief of the American Military Advisory Mission to the Philippines. General Merrill's awards and decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, and Combat Infantryman's Badge. General Merrill's strength of character, superior leadership, and exemplary service to the nation have set the example for other Rangers to follow.
Colonel George A. McGee is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary valor and exemplary service as commander of the 2d Battalion, 5307th Composite Unit, known as Merrill's Marauders. In August 1943 the War Department selected Colonel McGee to command a battalion-size unit formed from volunteers from the 33rd Infantry Regiment which was redesignated as 2d Battalion, 5307th Composite Unit. Colonel McGee served as battalion commander from the formation of Merrill's Marauders until their last mission at Myitkyina in June 1944. Colonel McGee led his battalion in missions behind enemy lines in the steaming jungles of Burma to sever Japanese communications and supply lines. Many of Colonel McGee's soldiers suffered from malaria, typhoid, malnutrition and other ailments, but fought gallantly against the Japanese in major battles at Walawbum, Nhpum Ga, Inkangawtaung, Shadazup, and Myitkyina, and were involved in over 30 minor engagements with the enemy.

Sergeant Robert L. Carr is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for valorous service to his country while with Merrill’s Marauders in Burma. He volunteered for the Marauders as a muleskinner in a pack artillery unit waiting in Australia to take part in the New Guinea fighting. While in Burma, Japanese forces trapped a Marauder battalion and under severe attack for several days, two 75-millimeter artillery pieces were parachuted in to aid the rescue units. Sergeant Carr volunteered with other former muleskinners to assemble and man the guns. He then volunteered to leave his position as a lead scout in an infantry platoon to serve as forward artillery, two of his fellow infantrymen were wounded. Sergeant Carr left his radio to drag each of the wounded through heavy fire to an aid man. Then he crawled forward throwing grenades toward Japanese lines to draw fire upon him so as to expose enemy positions and radioed back range and azimuth data for establishing fire. At that point, SGT Carr radioed, “Move in 10 yards and if you don’t hear from me, you’ll know I got too close”. Instead, Marauder shells wiped out an enemy heavy machine gun nest only 30 yards away from him, and were able to dig the enemy out of their holes all across a hill that had been their strong point. Marauder soldiers then drove through to free the trapped Marauder unit after a 10-day blockade that had exacted heavy American casualties forcing Japanese forces to beat a broad retreat. Sergeant Carr returned as a lead scout with the Marauders until their closing battle at Myitkyina, where he was evacuated with scrub typhus requiring a long hospitalization. Two officers told him they had put him in for a Silver Star for his role in effecting the breakthrough. But a mule carrying the records fell off a cliff en route over a 5,800-foot high mountain range to Myitkyina and all records were lost. When he was discharged after World War II, SGT Carr worked in a steel mill, then as a passenger boat captain, and in heavy construction, rising in 30 years to supervisor of major projects and retirement as a company vice president. Sergeant Carr’s determination and remarkable bravery in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds exemplify the Rangers’ resolve to complete the mission.

Philip B. Piazza enlisted at Ft. Wheeler, GA, where he received basic training and was expeditiously promoted to the grade of First Sergeant in a period of eight months. Turning down a commission in the medical field, he was sent to the Infantry Officers Candidate School. He was commissioned in 1942, and was selected to ship out to combat duty in Africa, but a change in orders sent him to the Dutch West Indies then to Trinidad. Here he was assigned to the 33rd Infantry where he served as XO of Company E. In September 1943 he volunteered for a dangerous and hazardous mission somewhere, and later moved with elements of the 33rd back to the Zl only to ship out from Camp Stoneman on the Lureline to Bom Bay, India. The now First Lieutenant was placed in command of the heavy weapons of one platoon of the six combat teams composing the famous 5307 Provisional Unit known as Merrill's Marauders. The Combat mission behind enemy lines began with a 125 mile conditioning foot march and terminating about 750 miles behind the Japanese units that were confronting friendly Chinese troops in the Mogaung/Hukong valleys of north and central Burma. The unit got the orders to establish and hold a road block for 24 hours on the enemy M.S.R. They held for 38 hours. Finally being able to extract from combat due exclusively to the heavy weapons supporting fires of LT Piazza with disregard for his personal safety observing from an advance position for his mortar and machine guns. The success of this mission denied General Tanaka and the Japanese 1 8th Imperial Division to retake approximately 35 miles of the Hukong valley which had just been liberated by our aggressive position. At the south end of the Mogaung valley, the unit was hit by a series of banzai attacks. Once again, while observing the machine gun and mortar fire at his position from an advance location LT Piazza was hit in the head by two rounds of enemy small arms fire and in the leg by a mortar shell burst. Once again, the effectiveness of heavy weapons enabled the battalion to withdraw to safety. Capt. Piazza was litter borne about eight miles to an evacuation strip from which, seven days later, he was flown to the 20th General Hospital in India. He spent the next year convalescing before being discharged from active duty. Military awards include the Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman Badge, Purple Heart with cluster, Presidential Unit Citation, and several campaign medals.

While serving as a lead scout with the 1st Battalion Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon of Merrill's Marauders in Burma, he repeatedly moved out in front of his combat team, exposing himself to danger numerous times, reconnoitering the terrain, and the enemy's position, gathering information and selecting safe trails to travel by. In preparation for the main attack on the airfield and village of Myitkyina, Staff Sergeant Branscomb's unit was ordered by Colonel Hunter, the Deputy Commander of the Marauders, to move ahead and reconnoiter the strength and disposition of the enemy troops and to check the condition of the runway. He proceeded at night and found gun emplacements surrounding the field as well as a crew of laborers repairing the runway. Staff Sergeant Branscomb reconned the entire airfield and radioed that the airfield would not be safe for the gliders and DC-3s to bring in supplies and much needed medical equipment. He mapped out the position of the emplacements, noted the strength of the enemy, and reported back to his unit. His thoroughness in reconnaissance allowed the Marauders to close with and consistently destroy the remainder of a Chinese Division. Staff Sergeant Branscomb was a man of great experience and valor who exceeded the standard. His actions exemplify a soldier who ""moves further, faster, and fights harder than any ether soldier.</b>

Sergeant Robert L. Carr is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for valorous service to his country while with Merrill’s Marauders in Burma. He volunteered for the Marauders as a muleskinner in a pack artillery unit waiting in Australia to take part in the New Guinea fighting. While in Burma, Japanese forces trapped a Marauder battalion and under severe attack for several days, two 75-millimeter artillery pieces were parachuted in to aid the rescue units. Sergeant Carr volunteered with other former muleskinners to assemble and man the guns. He then volunteered to leave his position as a lead scout in an infantry platoon to serve as forward artillery, two of his fellow infantrymen were wounded. Sergeant Carr left his radio to drag each of the wounded through heavy fire to an aid man. Then he crawled forward throwing grenades toward Japanese lines to draw fire upon him so as to expose enemy positions and radioed back range and azimuth data for establishing fire. At that point, SGT Carr radioed, “Move in 10 yards and if you don’t hear from me, you’ll know I got too close”. Instead, Marauder shells wiped out an enemy heavy machine gun nest only 30 yards away from him, and were able to dig the enemy out of their holes all across a hill that had been their strong point. Marauder soldiers then drove through to free the trapped Marauder unit after a 10-day blockade that had exacted heavy American casualties forcing Japanese forces to beat a broad retreat. Sergeant Carr returned as a lead scout with the Marauders until their closing battle at Myitkyina, where he was evacuated with scrub typhus requiring a long hospitalization. Two officers told him they had put him in for a Silver Star for his role in effecting the breakthrough. But a mule carrying the records fell off a cliff en route over a 5,800-foot high mountain range to Myitkyina and all records were lost. When he was discharged after World War II, SGT Carr worked in a steel mill, then as a passenger boat captain, and in heavy construction, rising in 30 years to supervisor of major projects and retirement as a company vice president. Sergeant Carr’s determination and remarkable bravery in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds exemplify the Rangers’ resolve to complete the mission.</b>

He led one platoon in a successful counter-attack; organized a perimeter defense with 50 men; and inspired them by word and deed to hold the position, despite four Banzai attacks by more than 400 enemy soldiers. With ammunition running out, he ordered the withdrawal of his unit while personally guarding its rear with six men. Although wounded, he remained until sure that the main body and other wounded were able to withdraw safely. After his recovery, he held assignments in the Pentagon, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning and retired from military service in 1954. For extraordinary heroism in two wars, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with Oak Leaf Cluster; the Silver Star; the Bronze Star, with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters; the Purple Heart, with two Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge with Star.</b>

FRANK DOW MERRILL 1903-1955
Frank Dow Merrill was born at Hopkinton Mass. on Dec 4, 1903. He enlisted in the regular army in 1922 and graduated from West point in 1929. He obtained his B.S. degree in military engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Assigned to Tokyo in 1938, Merrill studied Japanese and Chinese while working as the assistant military attache at the United States Embassy in Tokyo. By 1941 he was promoted to major (temporarily) and assigned to Manila as General Douglas MacArthur's intelligence officer. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Merrill was in Rangoon, Burma on a flying mission for MacArthur, and was assigned to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations when the U.S. entered World War II. In the Spring of 1942 Merrill was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. In July 1942 He was awarded the Order of the Purple Heart and other medals for his meritorious actions in Burma between March and May 1942. In October 1943, Merrill became operations chief for Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell. As such he organized the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), a long range penetration group, for a hazardous mission in Burma. After intensive training in jungle warfare, ""Merrill's Marauders"" as they became known, became the first American infantrymen to fight on the Asiatic mainland. Merrill was promoted to Major General In 1945 Merrill was Chief of Staff at the 10th Army, Okinawa. In 1947 he was with the U.S. military advisory group to the Republic of the Philippines. He retired from the army in 1948 with the rank of Major General. After retirement from the Army, Merrill moved back to New Hampshire with his wife and two sons to become New Hampshire's Highway Commissioner The physical and mental hardships of his campaign in Burma during the second world war had left their mark on Merrill and he died, at the age of 52, at Fernandina Beach Fla. while attending a meeting of the American Association of State Highway Officials, where he had just been elected president of that organization. He was one of America's truly great generals.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/b_hist_g.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_so_3.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_hof_r.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_books.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_maps.gif"" /><br />

They were not a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital), They had limited supplies and equipment to fight their battle against tropical diseases, fevers of unknown origins, and the wounds suffered by their fellow Marauders. Often risking their own lives to save the lives of and treat the men of Galahad, these brave men of the medical detachment were never far from the fighting and many times had to perform with a battle raging around them. They marched with the other Marauders over the most hostile battle ground ever encountered by an American armed force, suffering the same fatigue, diseases, malnutrition, wounds and death as the rest of the Marauders. It is to these brother Marauders, who's names are listed below that many of the surviving Marauders owe a debt which could never be repaid

"POEMS ABOUT MERRILL&#39;S MARAUDERS","Poems About & By Merrill's Marauders
Merrill’s Marauders Last Stand at Myitkyina
By: Pfc. Ralf L. Keasling.
At Myitkyina today they lie at rest There were soldiers all and gave their best They fought and died in days of rain And preyed for sun that never came. Through mud they crawled to find their foe They cursed and swore but on they go As days went by and night fell They all slept on the walls of hell. Artillery shells with their melody of death Whizzed by with each and every breath As dawn came to light the earth Amid sniper fire through dirt In falling rain they fought on Hope to live by those had gone. Myitkyina has fallen at last They would be glad to know of the finished task But the trails are filled with yankee blood Of gallant men who fought died in Burma mud Courageous men these, they fought and fell Bless them all, God; treat them well.
REGIMENT OF VOLUNTEERS
By: 2Lt. CHARLTON OGBURN JR. Merrill's Marauders, 1st Battalion White Combat Team
Burma 1944
Where the Jap has placed his outposts, Where his road-blocks guard the trail, Where the lone patrol is moving, As the dark begins to pale; There's a wisper through the jungle, There are shadows on the tracks, And the sentry wheels to fire When a twig behind him cracks. For Merril's men are marching; They've been seen at Masakawng; They have crossed th Tanai River, And they're threatening Warong. Jungle trails are close and silent; Merrill's troops move swift and far; They may pass today through Sharaw And tomorrow through Sana. Tokyo Has maps of Burma That will show whence they have come. See that red line down the Hukawng, See the cross at Walawbum? There's another at Shaduzup, And Below, Inkangahtawng. The Marauders' roll of victories Is both barbarous and long. From Nhpum Ga on to Ritpong, (Add a cross at each of these) Red lines lead to Myitkyina-- Just you ask the Japanese. Stealthy files that strike and vanish, No one knows where they may be. Till the Browning automatics Leave dead Japs for Japs to see. But if you want to see us, There's a way you can't go wrong. Pick a trail that goes behind them Where our enemies are strong. Where the trail goes through a rice field You may see the column clear; But--we're not so much tolook at, And we're worsa than that to hear. Comes a line of weary scarecrows, Bearded, pale, unclean, and hot. Never would you think of soldiers, (Wich we wish that we were not). ""Damn the mountains"" How we curse them! ""Damn the food or what there is. ""Damn the mules, and General Stilwell. ""God, we wish our feet were his!"" Well, it's true, and it's because Everyone had reasons why he Did not like it where he was. We're the misfits of the Army That the system can't digest; There's but one way to control us, And it's not to let us rest Doctors, farmers, drunkards, failures, There's no trait we share but one; We have to butt our heads into those Things that aren't or can't be done. ""Put 'em on . . . The column's moving!"" Come on, then, you're not yet dead. And there's fighting left a-plenty While the trail still leads ahead. Let the fevers try to stop us; We've got dysentery now; Still we'll keep the column rolling, Though we could not say just how. Half a thousand miles we've walked, Over hills in rain and heat, And the marches all have measured That much more of Jap retreat. For Merrill's men are marching; We have come both fast and far, And we've opened northern Buma From Maingkan to Myitkyina; And there'll be no final halting (So we fear it's bound to be) Till the last mule's legs have buckled Or we've reached the China Sea.","<p><img src=""http://marauder.org/b_merril.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_so_3.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_hof_r.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_books.gif"" /> <img src=""http://marauder.org/b_maps.gif"" /><br />

""Damn the food or what there is. ""Damn the mules, and General Stilwell. ""God, we wish our feet were his!"" Well, it's true, and it's because Everyone had reasons why he Did not like it where he was. We're the misfits of the Army That the system can't digest; There's but one way to control us, And it's not to let us rest Doctors, farmers, drunkards, failures, There's no trait we share but one; We have to butt our heads into those Things that aren't or can't be done. ""Put 'em on . . . The column's moving!"" Come on, then, you're not yet dead. And there's fighting left a-plenty While the trail still leads ahead. Let the fevers try to stop us; We've got dysentery now; Still we'll keep the column rolling, Though we could not say just how. Half a thousand miles we've walked, Over hills in rain and heat, And the marches all have measured That much more of Jap retreat. For Merrill's men are marching; We have come both fast and far, And we've opened northern Buma From Maingkan to Myitkyina; And there'll be no final halting (So we fear it's bound to be) Till the last mule's legs have buckled Or we've reached the China Sea.</b></p>

"Merrill&#39;s Marauders - The Marauders Samurai","Go To The Nisei Story
Return To History Page#2
This page is dedicated to 15 very extraordinary men who are in every sense, American Heroes. These men, 14 of which are Japanese Americans, known as ""Nisei"" (First generation born in the U.S.). Of these 14 men, 7 came from Hawaii, where the Japanese Americans where not subject to Internment Camps, the remaining 7 came from the continental U.S., 3 of which where already in the Army when the war broke out. While with the Marauders the leader of this group of M.I.S. men was 1st Lt. William A. Laffin, whose mother was Japanese. 1st Lt. Laffin was stuck in Japan when the war broke out and was repatriated when the U.S. and Japan exchanged nationals. These 15 men volunteered to serve their country in the Military Intelligence Service even though some where forced from their homes and livelihoods, and moved to remote internment camps. Yet once in the service of the Military Intelligence Service, all 15 volunteered a second time for a ""Dangerous And Hazardous Mission"", and became members of the 5307th Composite Unit Provisional, better known as ""Merrill's Marauders"". These heroes, along with the Marauders, were in constant combat deep behind enemy lines in the Jungles and mountains of Burma. One can only imagine what would have happened to them if captured by the Japanese. Doubling as interpreters while with the Marauders they were involved in many acts of heroism. In the face of danger they acted with total disregard for their own safety, using their knowledge of the enemy and the Japanese language, they saved countless lives of their brother Marauders.
GENERAL MERRILL'S EVALUATION OF THE NISEI GROUP:
""As for the Nisei group, I couldn't have gotten along without them. Probably few realized that these boys did everything that an infantryman normally does plus the extra work of translating, interrogating, etc. Also they were in a most unenviable position as to identity as almost every one from the Japanese to the Chinese shot first and identified later."" From ""THE MARAUDERS"" A Book By Charlton Ogburn:
"". . . their persistent volunteering to go forward to intercept the commands of the enemy when the lead units were engaged by trailblocks. What was unspeakably hard for the others can only have been harder still for them. Some had close relatives living in Japan, all had acquaintances, if not relatives held in the concentration camps in the United States on the grounds that persons of Japanese descent and feature must be presumed disloyal. . . . What were their thoughts in the solitude of soul that jungle warfare enforces? I have no way of knowing. But in the case of Sergeant Roy Matsumoto, whose mother was living in Japan, we may perhaps justifiably surmise that he took some comfort from the reflection that she was not in one of the major cities but in a smaller one less likely to attract attack by American bombers - - Hiroshima.""

"Merrill&#39;s Marauders - Secret Orders #3","These pages have been transcribed from the only known set of the original Special Order #3, from the 5307 Composite Regiment (Provisional), Dated: 5 January 1944. The 5307th was renamed the 5307 Composite Unit (Provisional) a few days later when General Frank D. Merrill took command of the unit. According to Army regulations a General cannot command a Regiment, so the 5307th was renamed a Unit. SO #3 is the orders transferring the original volunteers from the 3 separate travel and training Casual Detachments 1688A, 1688B, & 1688C into the newly named 5307 Composite Regiment (Provisional). This is the first time since the unit was disbanded that a complete listing of the approximately three thousand volunteers for a ""Dangerous and Hazardous Mission"" has been located. Because the unit and the mission was Secret, and the fact that the unit would be operating completely behind the Japanese lines, record keeping was held to a minimum. Then most of the records that were kept were destroyed when a Japanese artillery shell blew up the pack mule along with the records it was carrying. Members of the Merrill's Marauders Association have searched the records in Washington for these orders, without finding them. The Association was able to gather about 70% - 80% of the names from bits and pieces of other orders and records.
This, the only known set of SO #3 became available thanks to the family of Marauder 1st Lt. Leonard E. Fielder, Headquarters, Headquarters Detachment, 5307 Composite Unit (Provisional). Thanks to the generosity of 1st Lt. Fielder's wife Josephine and son Brad, The Association now has a complete listing of the original members of the Merrill's Marauders.","<td>

Weston was drafted into the Army in 1941. He worked his way up through the ranks to Staff-Sergeant before receiving a battle field commission to Second Lieutenant. Col. Weston's unwavering devotion to his country and to his faith have earned him a larger-than-life reputation and undying devotion from his men even to this day. He is considered one of the most heavily decorated soldiers in American history. Among the awards Col. Weston has earned is the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Stars, Bronze Stars, Purple Hearts a Legion of Merit, Presidential Unit Citations, the Combat Infantryman Badge (3 awards), and the Parachute Jump Badge (3 awards). Col. Weston has received Commendations from the Governments of Australia, Nationalist China, India, Korea, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. Col. Weston has been honored by Senate and House Resolutions from the states of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.

"MERRILL&#39;S MARAUDERS HISTORY","In August 1943 at the ""Quebec Conference"", President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and other allied leaders decided that an American Long Range Penetration Mission behind the Japanese Lines in Burma was needed to destroy the Japanese supply lines and communications and to play havoc with the enemy forces while an attempt was made to reopen the much needed Burma Road.
President Roosevelt issued a Presidential call for volunteers for ""A Dangerous and Hazardous Mission"". The call was answered by approximately 3,000 American soldiers. The volunteers came from State side units, from the jungles of Panama and Trinidad they came, from the campaigns of Guadalcanal, New Guinea, New Georgia they came, to answer the call, some battle scarred, some new to the ways of war, each different but with one thing in common. They Answered The Call.
The Unit was officially designated as the ""5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)"" Code Name: ""GALAHAD"", later it became popularly known as ""MERRILL'S MARAUDERS"" named after its leader, Brigadier General Frank Merrill. Formed into six combat teams (400 per team),color-coded Red, White, Blue, Green, Orange and Khaki, two teams to a Battalion, the rest formed the H.Q. and Air Transport Commands.
After preliminary training operations were undertaken in great secrecy in the jungles of Central India, the Marauders began the long march up the Ledo Road and over the outlying ranges of the Himalayan Mountains into Burma. The Marauders with no tanks or heavy artillery to support them, walked over 1,000 miles through extremely dense and almost impenetrable jungles and came out with glory.
In Five major (WALAWBUM, SHADUZUP, INKANGAHTAWNG, NHPUM GA, & MYITKYINA) and thirty minor engagements, they defeated the veteran soldiers of the Japanese 18th Division (Conquerors of Singapore and Malaya) who vastly outnumbered the Marauders. Always moving to the rear of the main forces of the Japanese the Marauders completely disrupted the enemy supply and communication lines, and climaxed their behind the lines operations with the capture of Myitkyina Airfield, the only all-weather airfield in Northern Burma.
The attack on Myitkyina was the climax to four months of marching and combat in the Burma jungles. No other American force except the First Marine Division, which took and held Guadalcanal for four months, has had as much uninterrupted jungle fighting service as Merrill's Marauders. But no other American force anywhere had marched as far, fought as continuously or had to display such endurance, as the swift-moving, hard-hitting foot soldiers, of Merrill's Marauders
When the Marauders attacked Myitkyina they had behind them over 800 miles of marching over jungle and mountain roads and tracks. They had to carry all their equipment and supplies on their backs and on the backs of pack mules. Re-supplied by air drops the Marauders often had to make a clearing in the thick jungle to receive the supplies.
Every wounded Marauder was evacuated, an extraordinary feat in itself. Each wounded Marauder had to be carried on a makeshift stretcher (usually made from bamboo and field jackets or shirts) by his comrades until an evacuation point was reached. These evacuation points where mostly small jungle village's, where the Marauders would then have to hack out a landing strip for the small Piper Cub Evac. Planes. The brave sergeant-pilots of the air-rescue unit would then land and take off in these very hazardous conditions, removing every seriously wounded Marauder one at a time. The small planes, stripped of all equipment except a compass, had room for the pilot and one stretcher.
At the end of their campaign all remaining Marauders still in action were evacuated to hospitals suffering from tropical diseases, exhaustion, and malnutrition or as the tags on their battered uniforms said ""A.O.E."" (accumulation of everything).
For their accomplishments in Burma the Marauders were awarded the ""DISTINGUISHED UNIT CITATION"" in July, 1944. However in 1966 this award was redesignated as the ""PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION"" which is awarded by the President in the name of Congress. The Marauders also have the extremely rare distinction of having every member of the unit receive the ""BRONZE STAR"".
The unit was consolidated with the 475th Infantry on August 10, 1944. On June 21, 1954, the 475th was redesignated the 75th Infantry. It is from the redesignation of Merrill's Marauders into the 75th Infantry Regiment that the modern-day 75th Ranger Regiment traces its current unit designation...

We'll drape his casket with a banner of beautiful hues, Those glorious American colors: red, white and blue. That star spangled banner he gallantly fought to defend, Unyielding and undaunted, he fought to win. He fought bravely and he passed the battle test. Now the Supreme Commander grants him, ""eternal rest"". With dignity and honor, we'll commit his body to the ground, The bugler will sound ""Taps"" and we'll fire the volley rounds. The final military honors we'll render somberly and ever so sadly; ""Old Glory"" we'll solemnly precisely fold and reverently give to his family.

This decision to send the men into combat with the prospect of inadequate daily caloric intake was not sanctioned by the dotors and was to play an important part in the poor strength and general health of the Marauders."" (James E. T. Hopkins MD. - Spearhead - 1999)
After a battle ""our other enemy took over: hunger. We were perpetually famished. Not only were K rations lacking in bulk, but every fourth or fifth day we ran out of them. We had two conditions -- one in which we felt unfed, the other in which we were unfed."" (Charlton Ogburn Jr. - The Marauders - 1956/1959)

"THE MARAUDERS PATCH","The 5307th Composite Unit was a provisional unit and as such the US Army did not give it Unit Colors, a shoulder patch, or any other form of Identity, that the 5307th could call it's own. It was the newspapers that gave the 5307th the name ""Merrill's Marauders"" after it's Commanding Officer, Gen. Frank D. Merrill. The patch was designed and adoupted by the Marauders. The design although never official is the patch that every Marauder will tell you is the symble of
who they are.
""THE PATCH"" SYMBOLISM OF THE DESIGN
Original Patch FromThe Uniform OfS/Sgt
Robert E. Passanisi
* The Colors: Blue, White, Red & Green represent 4 of the 6 Marauders combat teams. * The Sun: From the Chinese National Flag for the unit's close cooperation with Chinese forces in Burma. * The Star: Represents the ""Star of Burma"" for the Marauders area of operations. * The Lightning Bolt: Stands for the speed and force
that the Marauders struck the enemy.
Although the Marauders where not designated as an official Ranger Unit They where considered a Ranger type unit. When the Army formed the ""75th Ranger Regiment"" it selected the ""Merrill's Marauders"" as the unit the Regiment would draw it's lineage from and authorized the the Marauders
the right to wear the Ranger Tab

"Merrill&#39;s Marauders - The Nisei Story","Go To Marauder Samurai
Return To History Page#2
The Nisei were the second generation of Japanese to call America home. This generation was both Japanese and American in attitude and cultural heritage. Many of the young Nisei worked alongside their parents on family farms, in store front businesses, and in the timber mills while attending the local public school. On December 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor found the Nisei and their parents in a difficult situation. Fear of an attack by Japanese naval forces on the West Coast and resentment against them in California led some people to clamor for people of Japanese ancestry to be removed. Although Japanese American leaders had denounced the attack on Pearl Harbor and some civilian and military leaders voiced their support towards the Japanese Americans, political pressure from California congressmen, the media and the public to remove the Japanese from the West Coast was growing stronger.
On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. This decree gave the military the authority to exclude people from designated areas to prevent sabotage and espionage, but President Roosevelt knew that it would be used to remove people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast. The army and the Wartime Civil Control Administration (WCCA), the civilian branch of the Western Defense Command, began the process of notifying and rounding up all persons of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast into sixteen assembly centers for processing and placement into ten internment camps.
Some of the Japanese Americans were able to get sympathetic neighbors and friends to take care of their homes, farms and businesses. Many of the Japanese Americans lost a lifetime of hard work as they quickly sold their homes, farms, businesses and possessions. They were allowed to take one trunk full of clothes and possessions, but certain personal items such as radios and cameras were forbidden.
The internment camps were located away from West Coast cities in desolate locations like Minidoka, Idaho and Tule Lake, California. Quickly constructed with crudely built barracks, barbed wire fences and armed guards the internment camps appeared more like prisoner of war camps. Over 120,000 people were moved into the camps. Anxious to prove their loyalty to the United States the Nisei reluctantly accepted internment.
Men of the 442 on the move
Further complicating matters for the interned Japanese Americans occurred in February, 1943, when teams of Army officers and enlisted men visited the relocation centers to register draft age men for military service and others for non-military duty such as the Army Nurse Corps and WACs. Over 33,000 Nisei soldiers served in the American army during the war. Nisei soldiers were used in the Pacific Theater as interpreters as well as in combat in North Africa, Italy and France. The principle units in which the Nisei served were the 100th Infantry Battalion, which was formed in Hawaii, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, formed from volunteers from the internment camps, and the secret Nisei Military Intelligence Service whose members served with army and navy units from the Aleutians to the far reaches of the south Pacific. The Nisei soldiers became famous for their heroism and the high number of casualties they sustained in combat.

more about the 100/442-RCT
The 442nd/100th sustained 9,486 wounded and over 600 killed suffered, the highest casualty rate of any American unit during the war. For their heroism, the men of the 442nd/100th won fifty-two Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars and the Congressional Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously to Pfc. Sadao Munemori. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team also won seven coveted Presidential Unit Citations for its performance. The men in the 100th Battalion alone had earned 900 Purple Hearts, thirty-six Silver Stars, twenty-one Bronze Stars, and three Distinguished Service Crosses.
It is from this background that 14 extraordinary brave young men serving in the ""Nisei Military Intelligence Service"" volunteered for a ""Dangerous and Hazardous Mission"" and became members of the 5307th Composite Unit Provisional, better known as Merrill's Marauders. Assigned 2 to each of the six combat teams and 2 to the Headquarters, these men continuously performed acts of heroism while fighting against the Japanese Army in the jungle and mountains of Northern Burma.

"MERRILL&#39;S MARAUDERS: WEAPONS","Merrill's Marauders where a hard hitting, fast moving, long range penetration unit, who fought in the toughest and most hostile jungle in the war. The Marauders hit and run tactics and the fact that they had to carry all their equipment and supplies on their backs or on the backs of pack mules, did not afford them the luxury of having any heavy equipment with them. These weapons are the tools that the Marauders used as individual fighting men in the close-in, hand to hand jungle fighting that they encountered on an almost daily basis. ""CLICK ON THE WEAPON TO VIRTUALLY TEST FIRE IT""
Colt .45 - Model 1911
Semiautomatic Caliber: .45 (11.4mm) Magazine load: 7 round magazine Velocity: 830fps (253mps) Effective Range:32yds (30m) Weight: 2.43pds (1.1kg) Length: 8.62in (21.9cm) Invented by: John M. Browning First produced: 1911 The Colt .45, was regarded as a weapon of last resort, ideal for close hand to hand type of fighting. Although this weapon was standard issue for officers and squad leaders, many found their way into the hands of front line soldiers. It remained the standard issued sidearm for U.S. forces until it was replaced in 1984
Garand Rifle M1
Semiautomatic Caliber: .30 (7.62mm) Clip load: 8 round Clip Velocity: 2,800fps (853mps) Effective Range:600yds (550m) Weight: 9.5pds (4.3kg) Length: 43.6in (110.7cm) Invented by: John C. Garand First produced: 1936 The Garand was the standard issued U.S. riffle for most of WWII. Although it was in short supply until 1943, there were over 4 million produced by the end of WWII. It was an easy weapon to disassemble and clean, and provided good firepower with it's combination velocity and caliber. The one drawback to the Garand was the difficulty in removing partially fired clips, many GI's would simple fire off the remaining rounds to allow easy removal of the clip so they could be reloaded
Carbine M1, M1A1, M2
Semi-automatic & Fully-automatic Caliber: .30 (7.62mm) Magazine load: 15 & 30 round magazines Velocity: 1,972fps (600mps) Effective Range:83yds (75m) Weight: 5pds (2.3kg) Length: 35.6in (90.4cm) The M1 Carbine, proved to be a versatile weapon, its light weight and good fire power made it easier to master than a pistol, and ideal for medium to long range use. This made it the ideal weapon for mortar teams, machine gun crews, bazooka-men, or any one who had other equipment to carry. The M1A1 variant had a folding stock and was used mainly by paratroopers. By the end of WWII over 6 million Carbine's were produced.
Thompson Submachine Gun
Selective Fire (Semi-automatic & Fully-automatic) Caliber: .45 (11.4mm) Drum or Magazine load: 50 round Drum, 20-30 round magazines Velocity: 920fps (280mps) Effective Range:55yds (50m) Weight: 11pds (4.9kg) Length: 33.7in (85.6cm) Invented by: John T. Thompson First produced: 1921 The Thompson Submachine Gun (AKA Tommy Gun) used the same caliber slug as the ""Colt .45"" and could fire it's 50 round drum in less than 4 seconds when selected to full automatic, making it a devastating weapon for close combat. The Tommy Gun performed well when exposed to rain, mud, and dirt, its drawbacks were its weight (11 pounds), and it's lake of accuracy at ranges over 50yards
Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) M1918A1 & M1918A2
Selective Fire (Semi-automatic & Fully-automatic) Caliber: .30 (7.62mm) Magazine load: 20 round magazine Velocity: 2,800fps (853.4mps) Effective Range:600yds (550m) Weight: 18.5pds (8.33kg) Length: 47in (119.4cm) Invented by: John M. Browning The Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was a popular weapon in all theaters of WWII, because it provided units with a combination of rapid fire (up to 650rpm), and penetrating power. The BAR was well received for it's reliability under adverse conditions. The only draw back to the BAR was its lack of a quick change barrel to help reduce the chance of overheating
