    <p><font color="navy"><b>Did you hear the sad news today?<br>
    Another veteran warrior has passed away.<br>
    Called by the Supreme Commander over all.<br>
    Today he has made his final roll call.<br>
    <br>
    Come fellow vets; let us reverently bow and pray<br>
    For our valiant comrade, who has fallen this day.<br>
    We'll drape his casket with a banner of beautiful hues,<br>
    Those glorious American colors: red, white and blue.<br>
    <br>
    That star spangled banner he gallantly fought to defend,<br>
    Unyielding and undaunted, he fought to win.<br>
    He fought bravely and he passed the battle test.<br>
    Now the Supreme Commander grants him, "eternal rest".<br>
    <br>
    With dignity and honor, we'll commit his body to the ground,<br>
    The bugler will sound "Taps" and we'll fire the volley rounds.<br>
    The final military honors we'll render somberly and ever so sadly;<br>
    "Old Glory" we'll solemnly precisely fold and reverently give to his family.<br>
    <br>
    Each Memorial Day we will recall our fallen comrade names,<br>
    And attest that their selfless sacrifices were not in vain;<br>
    For this lasting legacy they gave to all generations;<br>
    "It's honorable to respect our flag and to defend our great nation."<br>
    <br>
    So close ranks aging warriors, for our ranks are thinning.<br>
    We must keep on fighting and keep on winning.<br>
    With pride and honor we'll march and stand tall,<br>
    And we'll proudly - proudly - salute "Old Glory"<br>
    'til we too make our final roll call.<br>
