        These Marauders, formerly members of the pack artillery in the fighting in New Guinea, were assigned as muleskinners when they volunteered for the Marauders, who at first had no artillery. So when two pack-artillery pieces were air-dropped to help break the Japanese encirclement of another Marauder unit at Nhpum Ga, this crew and one other were whipped together quickly and within two hours of the drop were pounding the Japanese with the howitzers.</b></td>
