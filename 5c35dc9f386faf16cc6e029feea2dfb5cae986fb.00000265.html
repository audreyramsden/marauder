          <b>3/22/44 (3/24/44) - 5 mi to dropping. Went down hill for 2 mi instead of five. Crossed one river 50 TIMES. My feet and clothes was really wet. Got rations continued on toward mission. It rained cats and dogs. Marched until 11:00pm.<br>
          3/23/44 (3/25/44) - Marched in rain until noon really muddy and slippery up and down hills. Went to river, where roadblock was put in, got there about dark. Heard a lot of Japs trucks moving up and down road.<br>
          3/24/44 (3/26/44) - Cross river today. Japs brought in reinforcements last night. We are supposed to hold road block 24 hours. Until Chinks get here. Japs artillery shelled us for about ½ day. They shelled the hell out of us. Very few hit home, hit within 30 yds. of me. Shrapnel hit close to me, some hit knife and helmet. Air forces saved the day for us. We had 7 wounded none killed. Japs charged our machine guns, they must have been doped up. Killed over 200 Japs. We pulled out, we destroyed a lot of equipment had to hand carry everything. We lost four men.<br clear="all"></b><br>
