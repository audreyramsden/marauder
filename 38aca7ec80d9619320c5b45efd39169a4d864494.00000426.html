He volunteered for duty with the 5307th Composite Unit, known as Merrill's Marauders. in September 1943. Colonel Weston served as a platoon leader with the Marauders from January through September 1944, and fought in twenty-three separate conflicts with the enemy. Many of Colonel Weston's soldiers were malnourished, and stricken by disease, but inspired by his leadership, they spearheaded the Marauders drive south from Tibet through northern Burma. Colonel Weston fought with distinction in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War as an infantryman, but also served as unit chaplain due to his theological training, which earned him the title, "The Fighting Parson." Colonel Weston's awards and decorations include two Distinguished Service Crosses, five Silver Stars, seven Bronze Stars with "V" device, six Purple Hearts, and the Legion of Merit. Colonel Weston's exceptional leadership, and exemplary service throughout his 28 year military career are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army Rangers, and provide an inspiring example for all who serve our great nation.</b></font></th>
