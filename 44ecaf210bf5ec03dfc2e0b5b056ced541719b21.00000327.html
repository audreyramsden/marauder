  <h2><b><font color="red">(1995)</font> CAPTAIN PHILIP B. PIAZZA</b></h2></a><br>
  Philip B. Piazza enlisted at Ft. Wheeler, GA, where he received basic training and was expeditiously promoted to the grade of First Sergeant in a period of eight months. Turning down a commission in the medical field, he was sent to the Infantry Officers Candidate School. He was commissioned in 1942, and was selected to ship out to combat duty in Africa, but a change in orders sent him to the Dutch West Indies then to Trinidad. Here he was assigned to the 33rd Infantry where he served as XO of Company E. In September 1943 he volunteered for a dangerous and hazardous mission somewhere, and later moved with elements of the 33rd back to the Zl only to ship out from Camp Stoneman on the Lureline to Bom Bay, India. The now First Lieutenant was placed in command of the heavy weapons of one platoon of the six combat teams composing the famous 5307 Provisional Unit known as Merrill's Marauders. The Combat mission behind enemy lines began with a 125 mile conditioning foot march and terminating about 750 miles behind the Japanese units that were confronting friendly Chinese troops in the Mogaung/Hukong valleys of north and central Burma. The unit got the orders to establish and hold a road block for 24 hours on the enemy M.S.R. They held for 38 hours. Finally being able to extract from combat due exclusively to the heavy weapons supporting fires of LT Piazza with disregard for his personal safety observing from an advance position for his mortar and machine guns. The success of this mission denied General Tanaka and the Japanese 1 8th Imperial Division to retake approximately 35 miles of the Hukong valley which had just been liberated by our aggressive position. At the south end of the Mogaung valley, the unit was hit by a series of banzai attacks. Once again, while observing the machine gun and mortar fire at his position from an advance location LT Piazza was hit in the head by two rounds of enemy small arms fire and in the leg by a mortar shell burst. Once again, the effectiveness of heavy weapons enabled the battalion to withdraw to safety. Capt. Piazza was litter borne about eight miles to an evacuation strip from which, seven days later, he was flown to the 20th General Hospital in India. He spent the next year convalescing before being discharged from active duty. Military awards include the Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman Badge, Purple Heart with cluster, Presidential Unit Citation, and several campaign medals. Also awarded by the National Chinese Army is the Chinese War Memorial Medal.<br>

  Staff Sergeant Branscomb is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his actions as a member of Merrili's Marauders during World War II. Before volunteering to join Merrill's Marauders for what was termed "a very dangerous mission" by the President of the United States, Staff Sergeant Branscomb saw considerable action with the 161st Infantry at Guadalcanal and New Georgia in the South Pacific. While serving as a lead scout with the 1st Battalion Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon of Merrill's Marauders in Burma, he repeatedly moved out in front of his combat team, exposing himself to danger numerous times, reconnoitering the terrain, and the enemy's position, gathering information and selecting safe trails to travel by. In preparation for the main attack on the airfield and village of Myitkyina, Staff Sergeant Branscomb's unit was ordered by Colonel Hunter, the Deputy Commander of the Marauders, to move ahead and reconnoiter the strength and disposition of the enemy troops and to check the condition of the runway. He proceeded at night and found gun emplacements surrounding the field as well as a crew of laborers repairing the runway. Staff Sergeant Branscomb reconned the entire airfield and radioed that the airfield would not be safe for the gliders and DC-3s to bring in supplies and much needed medical equipment. He mapped out the position of the emplacements, noted the strength of the enemy, and reported back to his unit. His thoroughness in reconnaissance allowed the Marauders to close with and consistently destroy the remainder of a Chinese Division. Staff Sergeant Branscomb was a man of great experience and valor who exceeded the standard. His actions exemplify a soldier who "moves further, faster, and fights harder than any ether soldier.<br>

  Private First Class Norman Janis is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his extraordinary feats of courage and actions as a member of Merrill's Marauders during World War II. Assigned to the 3d Battalion, I and R Platoon, Private First Class Janis participated on patrol deep into the jungle clad spurs of the Himalayan Mountains in deep enemy infested Burma. Early in the Far Eastern Japanese campaign, Private Janis won the admiration and respect of all members of the platoon for his expertise as a scout and platoon sharpshooter. Private Janis demonstrated his sharp shooting skills by detecting enemy snipers. An example of this skill was demonstrated when the platoon was fighting from Hsam-Shingyang to Nhpum to relieve the 2d Battalion. The I and R platoon leader and combat team commander were standing in a small clearing studying a map when an enemy sniper, located in a tree, fired a single shot. Private Janis observed a slight movement in the vines not obvious to anyone and at a range of about 300 yards dropped the sniper in one shot. Later examination proved it to be a heart shot. Private Janis was awarded the Sioux Tribal Red Feather, equivalent of a Medal of Honor. This is the highest award bestowed by the Sioux Nation for exceptional valor in combat. In his unassuming, quiet manner Private Janis preferred to work alone and identified himself as a ferocious Ranger. Norman Janis is the Tribal Chief of the Sioux and lives on the Sioux Tribe Reservation in South Dakota.<br>

Prior to his enlistment, Staff Sergeant Gosho and his family, including his pregnant wife, were forcibly relocated from their home in Seattle, Washington to a Japanese Internment Camp in Idaho. Even under these circumstances, he volunteered to fight for his country. The intelligence information that he repeatedly received was largely responsible for the success of his unit.

He joined Merrill's Marauders first campaign in Burma as commanding officer of the white combat team, 1st battalion. After the capture of the airfield at Myitkyina, and having participated in 35 battles without any relief or replacements, the Marauders were decimated form battle casualties, sickness, and disease. Although he was eligible to be rotated home, LTC Johnson elected to remain with his men and assumed command of the 1st Battalion. The remnants of the Regiment were reformed and reorganized into the 475th Infantry Regiment for the next phase of the arduous campaign and continued onto China. His leadership, according to Major General Ernest Easterbrook, the Commanding Officer, was so dynamic that many soldiers volunteered to stay on the mission. He commanded with great distinction, always leading the way, and on many occasions was seen to carry multiple packs and rifles of men who had become too exhausted on the treacherous mountain trails. He was a true leader. Shortly after his retirement from the Army, after 30 years of service, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was honored in July, 1965 by the Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge with the George Washington Honor Medal.<br>

  <h2><b><font color="red">(2000)</font> STAFF SERGEANT WARNER KATZ</b></h2></a><br>
  Staff Sergeant Warner Katz is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his heroic actions while a lead scout for the I&R platoon of Merrill's Marauders 3d Battalion. After volunteering at the request of President Roosevelt, for what was termed a "dangerous and hazardous mission", Staff Sergeant Katz repeatedly demonstrated his experience and keen observation abilities by detecting trip wires and scattered mine emplacements which he scouted out, marked, and planned by-pass routes through the dense jungle. His actions saved innumerable additional casualties. A number of times in various situations, he left his safe position within the perimeter to drag wounded comrades to safety. He was the first Marauder to kill an enemy and also the first to be wounded but he refused to be evacuated. Prior to his service with the Marauders he saw considerable action in the South Pacific in combat with the Americal Division in the Solomon Islands. Sergeant Katz exemplifies the motto of the Marauders," Sua Sponte", of their own accord, and the Rangers, Rangers Lead the Way". Sergeant Katz' decorations include the Bronze Star with cluster, purple Heart with cluster, Presidential Unit Citation and numerous service awards.<br>

  <h2><b><font color="red">(2001)</font> 1st Lt. EDWARD A. MC LOGAN</b></h2></a><br>
  Lieutenant Edward A. McLogan is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his exemplary conduct and actions in combat while serving with the 5307th Composite Unit Provisional (Merrill’s Marauders) in Burma in World War II. As a platoon leader he repeatedly risked his life rallying his men to stand off repeated Banzai attacks. At the Battle of Nhpum Ga, while the Marauders were surrounded for two weeks, at one time he pulled his men back 100 yards, booby trapped their former foxholes, and strategically positioned his men so that when the enemy attacked, they were completely surprised. After repeated attacks by the enemy and fierce hand-to-hand engagements, the Japanese retreated leaving over 50 bodies behind. After this action, the Marauders nicknamed it McLogan’s Hill in his honor. Prior to volunteering for a dangerous and hazardous mission behind enemy lines with the Marauders, Lieutenant McLogan served with the 35th Infantry Regiment in battles in the South Pacific at Guadalcanal and his platoon was selected to lead the way in the first wave of the invasion of the Soloman Islands at the Beach Head. He exemplifies the code of the Army Rangers in leading the way, and is a credit to his country and his unit. His awards include the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and the Presidential Unit Citation.<br>

  <h2><b><font color="red">(2002)</font> Sgt. ROBERT CARR</b></h2></a><br>
  Sergeant Robert L. Carr is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for valorous service to his country while with Merrill’s Marauders in Burma. He volunteered for the Marauders as a muleskinner in a pack artillery unit waiting in Australia to take part in the New Guinea fighting. While in Burma, Japanese forces trapped a Marauder battalion and under severe attack for several days, two 75-millimeter artillery pieces were parachuted in to aid the rescue units. Sergeant Carr volunteered with other former muleskinners to assemble and man the guns. He then volunteered to leave his position as a lead scout in an infantry platoon to serve as forward artillery, two of his fellow infantrymen were wounded. Sergeant Carr left his radio to drag each of the wounded through heavy fire to an aid man. Then he crawled forward throwing grenades toward Japanese lines to draw fire upon him so as to expose enemy positions and radioed back range and azimuth data for establishing fire. At that point, SGT Carr radioed, “Move in 10 yards and if you don’t hear from me, you’ll know I got too close”. Instead, Marauder shells wiped out an enemy heavy machine gun nest only 30 yards away from him, and were able to dig the enemy out of their holes all across a hill that had been their strong point. Marauder soldiers then drove through to free the trapped Marauder unit after a 10-day blockade that had exacted heavy American casualties forcing Japanese forces to beat a broad retreat. Sergeant Carr returned as a lead scout with the Marauders until their closing battle at Myitkyina, where he was evacuated with scrub typhus requiring a long hospitalization. Two officers told him they had put him in for a Silver Star for his role in effecting the breakthrough. But a mule carrying the records fell off a cliff en route over a 5,800-foot high mountain range to Myitkyina and all records were lost. When he was discharged after World War II, SGT Carr worked in a steel mill, then as a passenger boat captain, and in heavy construction, rising in 30 years to supervisor of major projects and retirement as a company vice president. Sergeant Carr’s determination and remarkable bravery in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds exemplify the Rangers’ resolve to complete the mission.<br>

  <h2><b><font color="red">(2002)</font> Dr. JAMES E. HOPKINS</b></h2></a><br>
  Dr. James E. Hopkins is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his outstanding conduct and actions while in combat with the Merrill’s Marauders during the China-Burma-India Theater in World War II. When War was declared, he left his surgical practice at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and volunteered for military duty in the Army Medical Corps. While serving in the Fiji Islands and seeing the many battle casualties in Guadalcanal, Dr. Hopkins left his plush assignment and volunteered for duty with a forward combat unit in various Soloman Island battles where he served as battalion surgeon with the 148th Regiment, Ohio National Guard. When the call came from the president for experienced combat troops for a dangerous and hazardous mission, he volunteered again and went with the unit that would eventually be known as the Merrill’s Marauders, where he gained the highest respect from the men in his battalion during that entire campaign he marched step-by-step with the men ministering to their many needs and although unarmed, repeatedly exposed himself to care for the wounded by documenting all his medical records during the entire operation during a period of 7 months behind enemy lines. He worked with the War department and was instrumental in the improvement of the helmet to protect head and neck and also in his concern for the safety of GI’s was instrumental in the development of the lightweight combat vests. Dr. Hopkins is a true patriot and well deserving of this award. His decorations include the Bronze Star, Combat Medical Badge, Presidential Unit Citation, Asiatic-Pacific Service Medal and American Defense Medal.<br>

  <h2><b><font color="red">(2003)</font> Lt Col MELVIN R. BLAIR</b></h2></a><br>
  Lieutenant Colonel Melvin R. Blair Lieutenant Colonel Melvin R. Blair is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for displaying exceptional valor in two wars. He enlisted in the Army in 1934 and served in the 13th Horse Cavalry Regiment at Fort Riley, Kansas, until assigned to the Cavalry ROTC unit at Norwich University, Northfield, Vermont. In 1942, he was commissioned upon his graduation and served as a platoon commander in the 10th Horse Cavalry Regiment at Camp Lockett, California. In World War II, he volunteered for Merrill’s Marauders and, upon arrival in Burma, was assigned as a reconnaissance platoon leader in the 209th Combat Engineers. When a patrol under his leadership was pinned down by machine gun fire, he crawled alone to the rear of the enemy position and killed the gun crew with his carbine. Three days later, when two members of his patrol were wounded, he crawled out under heavy enemy fire and brought them back. He earned a battlefield promotion to captain and was appointed the Executive Officer of the 3rd Squadron, 124th Cavalry Regiment. Shortly thereafter, he was wounded by enemy action but rejoined his unit in China. Following World War II, he attended the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Armor School, Fort Knox, Kentucky; and the G-2 course at Fort Leavenworth. He was then assigned to the G-2 staff in General Headquarters, Tokyo. During the Korean War, he served as a battalion commander in the 25th Infantry Division. After one of his companies lost all but one officer to enemy fire, he took over. He led one platoon in a successful counter-attack; organized a perimeter defense with 50 men; and inspired them by word and deed to hold the position, despite four Banzai attacks by more than 400 enemy soldiers. With ammunition running out, he ordered the withdrawal of his unit while personally guarding its rear with six men. Although wounded, he remained until sure that the main body and other wounded were able to withdraw safely. After his recovery, he held assignments in the Pentagon, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning and retired from military service in 1954. For extraordinary heroism in two wars, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with Oak Leaf Cluster; the Silver Star; the Bronze Star, with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters; the Purple Heart, with two Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge with Star.<br>
