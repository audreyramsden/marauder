          <p><font color="DARKGREEN"><b><font color="navy"><b>At Myitkyina today they lie at rest<br>
          There were soldiers all and gave their best<br>
          They fought and died in days of rain<br>
          And preyed for sun that never came.<br>
          <br>
          Through mud they crawled to find their foe<br>
          They cursed and swore but on they go<br>
          As days went by and night fell<br>
          They all slept on the walls of hell.<br>
          <br>
          Artillery shells with their melody of death<br>
          Whizzed by with each and every breath<br>
          As dawn came to light the earth<br>
          Amid sniper fire through dirt<br>
          In falling rain they fought on<br>
          Hope to live by those had gone.<br>
          <br>
          Myitkyina has fallen at last<br>
          They would be glad to know of the finished task<br>
          But the trails are filled with yankee blood<br>
          Of gallant men who fought died in Burma mud<br>
          Courageous men these, they fought and fell<br>
          Bless them all, God; treat them well.<br>

          Merrill's Marauders,<br>
          1st Battalion<br>
          White Combat Team<br>
          Burma 1944</b></font><br>
          <p><font color="navy"><b>Where the Jap has placed his outposts,<br>
          Where his road-blocks guard the trail,<br>
          Where the lone patrol is moving,<br>
          As the dark begins to pale;<br>
          There's a wisper through the jungle,<br>
          There are shadows on the tracks,<br>
          And the sentry wheels to fire<br>
          When a twig behind him cracks.<br>
          <br>
          For Merril's men are marching;<br>
          They've been seen at Masakawng;<br>
          They have crossed th Tanai River,<br>
          And they're threatening Warong.<br>
          Jungle trails are close and silent;<br>
          Merrill's troops move swift and far;<br>
          They may pass today through Sharaw<br>
          And tomorrow through Sana.<br>
          <br>
          Tokyo Has maps of Burma<br>
          That will show whence they have come.<br>
          See that red line down the Hukawng,<br>
          See the cross at Walawbum?<br>
          There's another at Shaduzup,<br>
          And Below, Inkangahtawng.<br>
          The Marauders' roll of victories<br>
          Is both barbarous and long.<br>
          <br>
          From Nhpum Ga on to Ritpong,<br>
          (Add a cross at each of these)<br>
          Red lines lead to Myitkyina--<br>
          Just you ask the Japanese.<br>
          Stealthy files that strike and vanish,<br>
          No one knows where they may be.<br>
          Till the Browning automatics<br>
          Leave dead Japs for Japs to see.<br>
          <br>
          But if you want to see us,<br>
          There's a way you can't go wrong.<br>
          Pick a trail that goes behind them<br>
          Where our enemies are strong.<br>
          Where the trail goes through a rice field<br>
          You may see the column clear;<br>
          But--we're not so much tolook at,<br>
          And we're worsa than that to hear.<br>
          <br>
          Comes a line of weary scarecrows,<br>
          Bearded, pale, unclean, and hot.<br>
          Never would you think of soldiers,<br>
          (Wich we wish that we were not).<br>
          "Damn the mountains" How we curse them!<br>
          "Damn the food or what there is.<br>
          "Damn the mules, and General Stilwell.<br>
          "God, we wish our feet were his!"<br>
          <br>
          Well, it's true, and it's because<br>
          Everyone had reasons why he<br>
          Did not like it where he was.<br>
          We're the misfits of the Army<br>
          That the system can't digest;<br>
          There's but one way to control us,<br>
          And it's not to let us rest<br>
          <br>
          Doctors, farmers, drunkards, failures,<br>
          There's no trait we share but one;<br>
          We have to butt our heads into those<br>
          Things that aren't or can't be done.<br>
          "Put 'em on . . . The column's moving!"<br>
          Come on, then, you're not yet dead.<br>
          And there's fighting left a-plenty<br>
          While the trail still leads ahead.<br>
          <br>
          Let the fevers try to stop us;<br>
          We've got dysentery now;<br>
          Still we'll keep the column rolling,<br>
          Though we could not say just how.<br>
          Half a thousand miles we've walked,<br>
          Over hills in rain and heat,<br>
          And the marches all have measured<br>
          That much more of Jap retreat.<br>
          <br>
          For Merrill's men are marching;<br>
          We have come both fast and far,<br>
          And we've opened northern Buma<br>
          From Maingkan to Myitkyina;<br>
          And there'll be no final halting<br>
          (So we fear it's bound to be)<br>
          Till the last mule's legs have buckled<br>
          Or we've reached the China Sea.<br>
